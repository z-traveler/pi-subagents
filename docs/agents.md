# Agents

An agent is a markdown file: YAML frontmatter on top, a system prompt below. The frontmatter defines the specialist that runs as the child session.

```yaml
---
name: scout
description: Fast codebase recon
tools: read, grep, find, ls
---

Your system prompt goes here.
```

## Where agents live

Lowest to highest priority:

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| Builtin | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/agents/` |
| Installed package | `package.json` `pi-subagents.agents` or `pi.subagents.agents` |
| User | `~/.pi/agent/agents/**/*.md` |
| Project | Project config `agents/**/*.md` (`.pi/agents/**/*.md` in standard Pi) |

Discovery notes:

- Project discovery also reads legacy `.agents/**/*.md` files. If both `.agents/` and the project config agents directory define the same parsed runtime agent name, the project config directory wins.
- Nested subdirectories are discovered recursively. `.chain.md` files do not define agents.
- User and project settings can add extra recursive scan roots with `subagents.agentScanDirs`; fixed user/project agent directories keep higher priority than same-name agents from scan roots.
- Use `subagents.agentExcludeDirs` to prune literal directory subtrees without disabling legacy agents. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#excluded-agent-directories-settings) for path resolution, scope, and exemptions.
- Installed Pi packages can expose agent directories from either `{"pi-subagents":{"agents":["./agents"]}}` or `{"pi":{"subagents":{"agents":["./agents"]}}}` in their package manifest. Package agents load above builtins and below user/project agents.
- Use `agentScope: "user" | "project" | "both"` to control discovery. `both` is the default, and project definitions win runtime-name collisions.

## Builtin agents

Builtins load at the lowest priority, so a user or project agent with the same name overrides them. They do not pin a provider model; they inherit your current Pi default model unless you set `subagents.defaultModel` or `subagents.agentOverrides.<name>.model` (see [models.md](models.md)).

| Agent | Use it when you want... |
|-------|--------------------------|
| `scout` | Fast local codebase recon: relevant files, entry points, data flow, risks, and where another agent should start. |
| `researcher` | Web/docs research with sources: official docs, specs, benchmarks, recent changes, and a concise research brief. |
| `evidence-auditor` | Independent evidence review of important claims in an existing research brief. |
| `worker` | Implementation work, including approved oracle handoffs. It edits files, validates, and escalates unapproved decisions instead of guessing. |
| `reviewer` | Code review and small fixes. It checks the implementation against the task/plan, tests, edge cases, and simplicity. |
| `oracle` | A second opinion before acting. It challenges assumptions, catches drift, and recommends the safest next move without editing. |
| `delegate` | A lightweight general delegate when you want a child agent that behaves close to the parent session. |

Rule of thumb: `scout` before you understand the code, `researcher` before you trust external facts, `evidence-auditor` before you rely on important research, `worker` to implement, `reviewer` to check, and `oracle` when the decision itself feels risky.

`oracle` is an advisory reviewer that critiques direction and proposes an execution prompt without editing files. `advisor` is the same bundled role under the Claude Code-compatible name.

### Optional Surf integration

When `surf-cli` is installed and loaded, Surf can expose a `gpt-pro` package agent through the `surf-oracle` external-job provider. It starts through the same `subagent({ agent: "gpt-pro" })` mental model as any other agent, but Surf owns the package agent and provider. Surf maps `model: pro` to ChatGPT GPT-5.6 Sol Pro web mode. pi-subagents does not own that model mapping.

If you disabled the old bundled `gpt-pro` workaround with `agentOverrides.gpt-pro.disabled`, remove that override before using Surf's package agent.

The Pi async run remains the source of truth for status, artifacts, wake/wait, mission attachment, retention, and diagnostics.

### Command-runner agents as typed steps

`runner.type: external-cli` with a plain `command` (no `adapter`) runs any local executable as a subagent: the assembled prompt is written to stdin, stdout becomes the child's output, and the run gets the usual run id, status, mission entry, and workflow key. This is how a classifier, a scoring script, or a small evaluation model becomes a `runs.run` step. Such agents are async-only (workflows launch children async by default; a direct `async: false` call is refused), receive no forked transcript, and cannot produce `structuredOutput` themselves; parse their `output` in the workflow, or pair them with a [typed gate](tool-reference.md#typed-gates). Generic commands are local-only; saved-machine placement accepts only the code-owned adapters below.

### Advisory runner data boundary

External CLI agents use their own runner contract. They are deliberate execution modes, not implicit recovery paths for a failed native `subagent` workflow. For backlog lanes and other subagent-governed workflows, switching to an external, foreground, or CLI runner requires explicit owner approval after the exact failure/run/worktree state is recorded and the worktree is verified clean or its partial diff is captured. Do not pass native Pi child options such as model override, structured output, acceptance/agent contract, tool budgets, fast mode, fork context, skills, or native Pi tools unless the adapter explicitly implements them.

The built-in `codex-exec` and `codex-exec-writer` profiles are the supported Codex one-shot modes. Both require an installed and authenticated Codex CLI. The adapters own `codex exec --json` argv with ignored user config and rules, ephemeral sessions, approval policy `never`, and a final-message artifact.

| Profile | Access | Sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| `codex-exec` | Read-only analysis | `read-only` |
| `codex-exec-writer` | Explicit workspace edits | `workspace-write` |

Neither adapter uses full access, approval or sandbox bypasses, automatic approval review, or additional writable roots. User profiles cannot add argv. The `codex-exec` selection identity is reserved for the read-only adapter.

Run it asynchronously:

```text
Use codex-exec to analyze this change without editing files.

Use codex-exec-writer to make the requested workspace changes.
```

The adapter validates `codex --version` and `codex exec --help` only when a run launches. Discovery, list, status, and native Pi launches do not execute Codex or its version/help probes. A capabilities listing performs only a passive PATH/PATHEXT/X_OK lookup and exposes the command as `runner.available`; that does not prove authentication or launch compatibility. JSONL, stderr, and stdout are untrusted. A run succeeds only after bounded valid JSONL contains one `turn.completed` event and the bounded final-message artifact is present.

Maintainers can collect real smoke evidence without making it part of the normal test suite:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENTS_CODEX_EXEC_SMOKE=1 \
PI_SUBAGENTS_CODEX_EXEC_SMOKE_REPORT=/tmp/pi-subagents-codex-exec-smoke.json \
node --experimental-strip-types --import ./test/support/register-loader.mjs \
  --test test/integration/codex-exec-smoke.test.ts

PI_SUBAGENTS_CODEX_EXEC_WRITER_SMOKE=1 \
PI_SUBAGENTS_CODEX_EXEC_WRITER_SMOKE_REPORT=/tmp/pi-subagents-codex-exec-writer-smoke.json \
node --experimental-strip-types --import ./test/support/register-loader.mjs \
  --test test/integration/codex-exec-writer-smoke.test.ts
```

The read-only smoke must report `writeCanaryExists: false`. The writer smoke must report `writeCanaryMatches: true`. Both reports include startup duration and terminal proof without raw protocol output, prompts, or credentials.

The built-in `claude-code` and `claude-code-writer` profiles are the supported Claude Code one-shot modes. Both require an installed Claude Code CLI that is already authenticated through its normal local login. Claude Code 2.1.150 needs the user setting source for normal OAuth/keychain authentication, so both adapters load user settings but exclude project and local settings. User-level Claude Code settings and hooks are therefore an operator-trusted prerequisite. Review or disable unsafe user hooks before using either profile.

| Profile | Access | Permission mode | Built-in tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | Handoff-only read-only advice | `plan` | none |
| `claude-code-writer` | Explicit workspace file edits | `acceptEdits` | `Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep` |

Both adapters own `claude -p` argv with stream JSON, strict empty MCP configuration, user-only setting sources, no session persistence, disabled slash commands, and disabled Chrome integration. The writer mode does not include Bash or any permission bypass. Neither mode uses `--bare`, which does not read normal OAuth/keychain authentication. Neither mode requires `--safe-mode`, which is absent from the installed 2.1.150 help. User profiles cannot add argv. Selecting the code-owned `claude-code-writer` adapter identity is the only way to opt into its write tools; the read-only adapter cannot be widened with user argv.

Run it asynchronously:

```text
Use claude-code to analyze this handoff without editing files.

Use claude-code-writer to make the requested file changes.
```

The adapter validates `claude --version` and `claude --help` only when a run launches. Discovery, list, status, and native Pi launches do not execute Claude Code or probe authentication. A capabilities listing performs only a passive PATH/PATHEXT/X_OK lookup and exposes the command as `runner.available`; that does not prove authentication or launch compatibility. JSONL, stderr, and stdout are untrusted. A run succeeds only after bounded valid JSONL contains exactly one successful terminal `result` with non-empty final text. Missing or revoked local authentication, limit stops, malformed JSON, duplicate terminal results, and EOF before a terminal result fail closed.

Maintainers can opt in to separate read-only and writer canaries:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENTS_CLAUDE_CODE_SMOKE=1 \
PI_SUBAGENTS_CLAUDE_CODE_SMOKE_REPORT=/tmp/pi-subagents-claude-code-smoke.json \
node --experimental-strip-types --import ./test/support/register-loader.mjs \
  --test test/integration/claude-code-smoke.test.ts

PI_SUBAGENTS_CLAUDE_CODE_WRITER_SMOKE=1 \
PI_SUBAGENTS_CLAUDE_CODE_WRITER_SMOKE_REPORT=/tmp/pi-subagents-claude-code-writer-smoke.json \
node --experimental-strip-types --import ./test/support/register-loader.mjs \
  --test test/integration/claude-code-writer-smoke.test.ts
```

Both smoke reports record `authentication: "existing-cli-required"`, `settingSources: "user"`, and `userSettingsTrust: "required"` without recording credential details. For read-only, confirm `terminalState` is `completed` and `writeCanaryExists` is `false`. For writer, confirm `terminalState` is `completed` and `writeCanaryMatches` is `true`. `durationMs` records cold process time. If authentication is missing or revoked, repair the normal local Claude Code login and rerun the smoke. Reports do not contain raw protocol output or credentials.

The built-in `cursor-agent` and `cursor-agent-writer` profiles are the supported Cursor CLI one-shot modes. Both require an installed Cursor CLI and either `CURSOR_API_KEY` or an existing local login.

| Profile | Access | Cursor mode |
|---|---|---|
| `cursor-agent` | Read-only analysis | `ask` |
| `cursor-agent-writer` | Explicit workspace edits | non-interactive print |

Both adapters use stream JSON, the enabled sandbox, and the primary workspace. They write the full handoff to a private `0600` file in a private temporary directory. Process argv contains only a short instruction with that path. The temporary directory is added as a workspace root only when it is outside the primary workspace. The prompt file and directory are removed after completion, failure, or stop.

The adapters do not pass force, yolo, auto-review, MCP approval, plugin, session resume, continue, worktree, or workspace trust flags. User profiles cannot add argv or workspace roots. The `cursor-agent` selection identity is reserved for the read-only adapter.

Launch preflight validates `cursor-agent --version` and `cursor-agent --help` only when a run starts. Discovery, list, status, and native Pi launches do not execute Cursor or probe authentication. A capabilities listing performs only a passive PATH/PATHEXT/X_OK lookup and exposes the command as `runner.available`; that does not prove authentication or launch compatibility. A run succeeds only when bounded valid JSONL ends with one successful `result` event that has non-empty final text. Error events, failed results, malformed JSON, output after the terminal event, and EOF before a result fail closed.

These headless smokes rely on saved workspace trust. Cursor documents no passive command that checks workspace trust, so the smoke cannot verify it before launch. The operator must use Cursor's interactive trust flow for the exact disposable workspace and the exact derived prompt directory, `<state-root>/external-0.cursor-prompt`. Keep that prompt directory after the trust step. It must be empty, owned by the operator who runs the smoke, and must not be a symlink. The harness preserves this directory but creates its private handoff with exclusive `0600` access and removes the handoff after every run. Repeat the trust setup if either exact path changes.

The smoke requires two existing, separate operator-managed directories and an explicit disposable-workspace attestation:

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_SMOKE_WORKSPACE=/tmp/pi-subagents-cursor-smoke-workspace
export PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_SMOKE_STATE_ROOT=/tmp/pi-subagents-cursor-smoke-state
export PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_SMOKE_DISPOSABLE=1
mkdir -p "$PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_SMOKE_WORKSPACE" "$PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_SMOKE_STATE_ROOT"
mkdir -p "$PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_SMOKE_STATE_ROOT/external-0.cursor-prompt"
```

Do not place a file at `pi-subagents-cursor-write-canary.txt` in the workspace or any file, including `handoff.txt`, in the prompt directory. The harness refuses the pre-existing canary and any non-empty prompt directory. It does not delete the workspace, state root, or operator-owned prompt directory. It removes only its canary and private handoff file.

Maintainers can then run separate read-only and writer canaries:

```bash
PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_AGENT_SMOKE=1 \
PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_AGENT_SMOKE_REPORT=/tmp/pi-subagents-cursor-agent-smoke.json \
node --experimental-strip-types --import ./test/support/register-loader.mjs \
  --test test/integration/cursor-agent-smoke.test.ts

PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_AGENT_WRITER_SMOKE=1 \
PI_SUBAGENTS_CURSOR_AGENT_WRITER_SMOKE_REPORT=/tmp/pi-subagents-cursor-agent-writer-smoke.json \
node --experimental-strip-types --import ./test/support/register-loader.mjs \
  --test test/integration/cursor-agent-writer-smoke.test.ts
```

The read-only smoke must report `writeCanaryExists: false`. The writer smoke must report `writeCanaryMatches: true`. Both reports record `workspaceTrust: "operator-managed-saved"`, confirm that the external prompt root was added, and include startup duration and terminal proof without raw protocol output, prompts, or credentials. A trust-required error remains terminal; the harness does not retry with a trust, force, or yolo flag.

Native `oracle` runs inside Pi and can use its configured read tools. The Claude profiles send the assembled prompt to the local Claude Code CLI through stdin. An external-job agent sends the assembled prompt to its registered provider. Provider options and a prompt digest are persisted in Pi run state. The prompt text is delivered through the local host bridge to the provider and is not stored in the public result payload. Do not place secrets in advisory prompts unless the target provider is approved to receive them.

### External-job state table

| Durable file | Owner | States | Release predicate | Rollback predicate | Stale-head behavior | Fail-closed cases |
|--------------|-------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `status.json` step `runner` and `externalJob` | pi-subagents async runner | `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `stopped`, `blocked` | Provider `result` returns terminal data and the async result is written | Provider start/follow-up/status/result/reattach returns an error | If a status file already has a provider job id, recovery calls `reattach` and `result`; it refuses to start a new prompt when the provider, prompt digest, parent job id, request id, request digest, or options differ | Missing provider, unsupported follow-up provider, capacity conflict, malformed provider response, bridge timeout, prompt digest mismatch, parent conversation missing |
| `result.json` or session result payload | pi-subagents async runner | `complete`, `failed`, `stopped` | All steps reach terminal state and result publication succeeds or is recoverably indexed | Result write fails and pending result repair records the terminal state | Stale status can repair from an existing result file | Unindexed sessionless stale failure |
| `external-job-requests/` and `external-job-responses/` | Host-mediated provider bridge | pending request, terminal response | Host process writes a matching response and removes the request | Bridge timeout or malformed request response | Requests are operation-scoped. Recovery sends `reattach`/`result`, not `start` or `follow-up`, when job metadata exists. `start` and `follow-up` use durable dispatch claims | Provider not registered, host bridge not loaded, malformed request, provider exception, ambiguous dispatch without a provider job id |
| Provider artifact path | External provider | provider-defined terminal artifact | Provider returns `artifactPath`, or Pi writes returned text to `external-job-<index>.result.md` | Provider reports failure or no result | Existing artifact path is retained in `status.json` | Missing artifact with no text output returns a terminal message instead of inventing content |

### Web research prerequisites

The `researcher` and `evidence-auditor` builtins use `web_search`, `fetch_content`, `get_search_content`, and selective `source_check` validation. Those require [pi-web-access](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-web-access):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-web-access
```

The provider must be loaded in the child and register all four tools, including `source_check`, before launch; a missing required tool prevents a successful run. Foreground children do not load ambient parent extensions: configure `extensions` or `subagentOnlyExtensions` explicitly, or use background extension discovery as described in [Tool and extension selection](#tool-and-extension-selection). For `researcher`, fetched-source inspection is a fallback for a registered `source_check` call failing, not for missing registration.

## Overriding builtins and custom agents

You can override selected agent fields without copying the whole agent. Overrides live in settings:

- User: `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
- Project: project config settings file (`.pi/settings.json` in standard Pi)

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "agentOverrides": {
      "reviewer": {
        "description": "Independent review tier",
        "inheritProjectContext": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported override fields: `description`, `machine`, `output`, `outputMode`, `defaultReads`, `modelClass`, `model`, `defaultProvider`, `fallbackModels`, `thinking`, `systemPromptMode`, `inheritProjectContext`, `inheritGlobalContext`, `inheritSkills`, `defaultContext`, `acceptanceRole`, `disabled`, `skills`, `tools`, and `systemPrompt`.

- `description` replaces the discovered description for builtin and custom agents, which lets list output show deployment-specific routing or model metadata.
- Use `output: false`, `defaultReads: false`, `defaultContext: false`, `acceptanceRole: false`, or `machine: false` to clear an inherited value.
- Use `tools: "inherit"` when that one role should omit its bundled or frontmatter tool allowlist and receive Pi's normal builtins (plus ambient extensions when it runs as a background child).
- Project overrides beat user overrides.
- Matching package, user, and project agents also receive override fields, which replace the same fields declared in their frontmatter. This lets a shared agent keep its persona while local settings choose the effective model, context, tools, or other supported options.

Disable and restore:

- `disabled: true` hides a builtin from runtime discovery and agent-facing `subagent({ action: "list" })` output.
- `subagents.disableBuiltins: true` disables all builtins at once.
- `subagent({ action: "disable", agent: "reviewer" })` writes the override without editing settings by hand; `subagent({ action: "enable", agent: "reviewer" })` removes it.
- `subagent({ action: "eject", agent: "reviewer" })` copies a bundled builtin or package agent verbatim into the user or project agent dir (default `user`) as an editable custom file that shadows the original.
- `subagent({ action: "reset", agent: "reviewer" })` deletes the scope's custom agent file and/or settings override entry, restoring the bundled default. It refuses if no bundled default exists (use `delete` for purely custom agents).

A custom agent file that shadows a bundled agent replaces the bundled definition wholesale; it does not inherit omitted frontmatter, including `acceptanceRole`. Custom implementation profiles must declare `acceptanceRole: writer` explicitly when writer acceptance inference is intended. Without it, automatic acceptance uses lightweight attestation as described in the [frontmatter reference](#frontmatter-reference).

`eject`, `disable`, `enable`, and `reset` accept `agentScope: "user" | "project"` and operate in one scope at a time. Project overrides still win over user ones, so a project-scope disable survives a user-scope `enable` until you target the project scope.

## Running external CLI agents on a Herdr saved machine

Native Pi and the six code-owned Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor profiles can run on a Herdr machine (`herdr machine add <target> --label <name>`). Herdr owns each visible agent process in a fresh no-focus pane; SSH is used only as bounded transport for Herdr RPC and ownership checks. Herdr's catalog is the host allowlist; raw ssh targets are rejected.

`machine` is a top-level frontmatter key, a settings override (`subagents.agentOverrides.<agent>.machine`, project beats user, `false` clears a pin), and a launch option on the `subagent` tool, workflow `runs.run`, chain, parallel, and dynamic-fanout steps. The launch option wins. Placement survives `subagent({ action: "disable" })`, `reset`, and model profile switches.

`cwd` means the directory on that machine when a machine is set. An absolute path or `~/...` is used as given; a relative path joins the repo's configured machine root; with no cwd the root is used; with no root the launch fails closed naming the setting:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "agentOverrides": { "claude-code": { "machine": "workmac" } },
    "machines": { "workmac": { "cwd": "/home/nico/proj" } }
  }
}
```

`machines.<label-or-id>.env` is rejected. No local API key, vendor environment, expanded prompt resource, extension path, or callback is copied. Remote runs use the machine's own credentials and managed model registry. Bounded probes and ownership checks use a fixed machine-owned PATH without sourcing shell profiles.

Placed external profiles are one-shot and stop-only: they cannot steer, resume, or claim a Pi supervisor. Their result is always `partial` and begins `[best-effort/unverified]`, because only bounded sanitized terminal snapshots are exposed; no vendor-private transcript, database, JSONL, or blob is used as authoritative settlement evidence. Reconnect observes the same pane and process without redispatching the prompt.

pi-subagents never clones, pulls, or checks out on the machine. Generic `external-cli` commands and managed worktrees are rejected before launch; saved-machine placement accepts native Pi and only the six code-owned external profiles.

## Parent prompt discovery

Set `advertise: true` in a specialist's agent file frontmatter for parent-prompt discovery. When the `subagent` tool is active, pi-subagents adds an agent-owned catalog of names and descriptions to the parent system prompt. Disabled agents and agents excluded by the current capability ceiling are omitted. Advertisement is not supported through settings overrides or runtime registration.

Advertisement is opt-in discovery, not automatic routing. The catalog is sorted by name and limited to 16 agents and 12,288 total rendered UTF-8 bytes, including XML escaping, instructions, and omission counts. Descriptions are capped at 512 UTF-8 bytes before escaping. Entries that cannot fit are omitted; canonical agent names are never truncated. The parent still calls `subagent({ action: "list", capabilities: true })` before execution to confirm that the selected agent is executable (including `runner.available === true` for external CLI agents).

The file catalog snapshot refreshes at session start/reload and after extension-owned agent-management mutations. External file or settings edits require `/reload`; ordinary turns do not poll the filesystem. Tool availability and capability-ceiling filtering are checked in memory on every prompt. A failed management-triggered refresh withdraws the catalog until a successful refresh, without changing the persisted mutation's result.

## Prompt assembly

Subagents are narrow by default. Custom agents start with a clean system prompt and only the context you intentionally give them. They do not automatically inherit Pi's whole base prompt, project instruction files, or discovered skills catalog.

Use these fields when an agent should see more:

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `systemPromptMode: append` | Append the agent prompt to Pi's normal base prompt. |
| `inheritProjectContext: true` | Keep inherited repository instructions from files like `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. |
| `inheritGlobalContext: true` | Also keep the operator's global context file from the Pi config agent directory (such as `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`). Defaults to `false`. |
| `inheritSkills: true` | Let the child see Pi's discovered skills catalog. |
| `defaultContext: fork` | Prefer forked session context when a launch omits `context`; if the parent has no persisted session file or current leaf yet, the implicit default falls back to `fresh` without a failed first attempt. Explicit `context: "fork"` remains strict, and explicit `context: "fresh"` still wins. |

Builtin agents opt into repository instruction inheritance by default so they follow repo-specific rules out of the box, but global context remains excluded unless `inheritGlobalContext: true` is set. This changes the behavior of existing agents that previously received global context as part of `inheritProjectContext: true`. `delegate` also uses append mode because its job is orchestration inside the parent workflow.

Simple-scalar list fields accept either a comma-separated form or a newline block list with one `- item` per line. This applies to `tools`, `excludeTools`, `allowedAgents`, `defaultReads`, `skill`/`skills`, `skillPath`, `extensions`, and `subagentOnlyExtensions`:

```yaml
tools:
  - read

```

Field notes:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `package` | Optional package identifier. A file with `name: scout` and `package: code-analysis` registers as `code-analysis.scout`; serialization keeps `name` and `package` separate. |
| `advertise` | Set `true` to include this agent's name and description in the parent system prompt when the `subagent` tool is active. Defaults to `false`. |
| `aliases` | Optional comma-separated or block-list names that resolve to this agent for selection and explicit `agent` and task inputs. Runtime status, persistence, and config still use the canonical `name`. Exact canonical names take precedence over aliases, and alias collisions between distinct canonical agents fail as ambiguous. |
| `tools` | Strict child tool allowlist. Named extension tools must also have their provider loaded. `mcp:` entries select direct MCP tools when `pi-mcp-adapter` is installed. |
| `excludeTools` | Optional child tool deny-list applied after normal tool resolution. With an explicit `tools` allowlist, matching names are removed; when `tools` is omitted, the names are excluded from the child session's default tool set. Unknown names are ignored by Pi without making the agent definition invalid. |
| `allowNestedSubagents` | Set `true` to authorize the child-safe nested `subagent` runtime without making omitted `tools` an allowlist. Inherited depth and capability ceilings remain authoritative. |
| `allowedAgents` | Restricts which canonical, case-sensitive agent names this agent may launch. Omitted adds no restriction; an empty list denies every descendant launch. This only narrows an existing nesting grant: `tools: subagent` or `allowNestedSubagents: true` is still required. Inherited/runtime allowlists are intersected and cannot be widened. |
| `extensions` | Omitted means a background child loads the parent's ambient extensions; empty means no ambient extensions; list values load exactly those extensions. Foreground children never load ambient extensions, so for them only listed values apply. |
| `subagentOnlyExtensions` | Extension paths loaded only in this agent's child sessions. Tools registered there are unavailable to the main agent unless also installed through normal Pi extension configuration. |
| `model` | Default model. Bare ids prefer the current provider when possible, then unique registry matches. |
| `modelClass` | Semantic named pool resolved from `subagents.modelPools`; may coexist with concrete frontmatter defaults for portability. |
| `fallbackModels` | Legacy ordered concrete backups. Named class pools use the same failure classifier and effect-safety rules. |
| `thinking` | Appended as a `:level` suffix at runtime unless a suffix is already present. |
| `systemPromptMode` | `replace` by default; `append` keeps Pi's base prompt. |
| `inheritProjectContext` | Keeps or strips inherited repository instruction blocks. |
| `inheritGlobalContext` | Keeps or strips the operator's global context file from the Pi config agent directory (e.g. `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`). It has an effect only when `inheritProjectContext` is `true`; otherwise all context files are already disabled. Defaults to `false`. |
| `inheritSkills` | Keeps or strips Pi's discovered skills catalog. |
| `defaultContext` | Optional `fresh` or `fork` launch-context preference. An implicit `fork` falls back to `fresh` when the parent has no persisted session file or current leaf; an explicit launch `context: "fork"` remains strict. |
| `skills` | Selects specific skills for the child, regardless of `inheritSkills`. |
| `skillPath` | Invocation-private skill files or discovery directories. Relative paths resolve from the agent definition file. Local matches take precedence, while unresolved or unreadable matches fall back to normal skill discovery. This field discovers candidates only; `skills` still selects what the child receives. |
| `output` | Default single-agent output file. |
| `defaultReads` | Files to read before running the agent. |
| `defaultProgress` | Maintain `progress.md`. |
| `async` | Default a single-agent launch to background (`true`) or foreground (`false`) when the call omits `async`. Explicit call values and `forceTopLevelAsync` win. |
| `timeoutMs` | Positive integer default runtime deadline in milliseconds for single-agent launches. Foreground launches use 30 minutes when neither the call nor agent provides a timeout; explicit `timeoutMs`/`maxRuntimeMs` and agent defaults win. |
| `toolTimeoutMs` | Optional positive integer hard per-tool-call deadline in milliseconds. An explicit call value wins, then this agent default, global `toolTimeoutMs`, and `PI_SUBAGENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`. When omitted, known-fast built-in tools get a five-minute default; long-running tools get attention notices but no hard default. It does not extend the run-level deadline; `contact_supervisor`, `intercom`, and `bg_wait` are exempt. |
| `acceptance` | Acceptance default for single-agent launches. Use a scalar level such as `checked` or an inline/block YAML map such as `{ level: "none", reason: "lightweight lookup" }`. Explicit call values win; chain and parallel acceptance remains task/step configuration. |
| `acceptanceRole` | Optional `read-only` or `writer` role for automatic acceptance inference. When omitted, automatic acceptance uses lightweight attestation; task wording and agent names do not escalate it. This does not grant or revoke tools. |
| `mutationTools` | Comma-separated extension tool names treated as mutating activity for runtime diagnostics, long-running-tool status, and timeout recovery. This is diagnostic only and never determines successful completion. List and load each tool through `tools` and its extension provider as usual. |
| `interactive` | Parsed for compatibility but not currently enforced. |
| `maxSubagentDepth` | Tightens nested delegation for this agent's children. |
| `memory` | Opt-in role-specific persistent memory. See below. |

### Required host extensions

Hosts can import `registerRequiredChildExtensions` from `pi-subagents/required-child-extensions` and register `{ sessionId, extensions: [{ id, path }] }`. Paths resolve to existing files and are canonicalized into an immutable launch snapshot; bounded safe IDs appear in evidence instead of paths. One registration is allowed per parent session until its idempotent `dispose()` runs, normally on `session_shutdown`.

Required paths follow ordinary extension resolution and survive agent defaults and `extensions: []` across native foreground, detached, nested, and recovery launches. A `capabilityCeiling.denyExtensions` conflict or required load/provider-registration failure rejects before model resolution. External runners are excluded, and status/watch paths do not query the registry.

Successful completion is determined by observable gates such as process outcome, required outputs, explicit acceptance, verification commands, independent review, and staged-index integrity. Best-effort mutation observations remain diagnostic: unchanged or unknown evidence does not fail a run, and observed changes do not prove correctness.

## Per-agent persistent memory

A recurring custom agent can opt into a durable, role-specific memory scope with the `memory` frontmatter field:

```yaml
memory:
  scope: project
  path: security-reviewer
```

This is independent of Pi's own parent/session/project memory system and writes nothing to it. Memory lives under a dedicated `agent-memory/` namespace so the two never collide.

How it works:

- On each run, the first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` in the resolved memory directory are injected into the child system prompt, so the agent can recall accumulated role notes such as threat-model entries, release gotchas, or verified commands.
- Project memory resolves to the main checkout from standard linked Git worktrees whose metadata lives under `<main>/.git/worktrees/`, so isolated children share one durable role memory and worktree cleanup does not remove it. Custom `--separate-git-dir` layouts keep their current project-root behavior because Git does not retain a safely verifiable main-checkout path there.
- Agents with write tools (`edit`, `write`, or `bash`, or no `tools` allowlist at all) are told they may append concise dated entries to the file.
- Agents without write tools receive a read-only memory block and are not instructed to edit it. A read-only reviewer can recall prior notes without gaining write capability.
- The memory directory is never created eagerly. The agent's own `write` tool creates it (and `MEMORY.md`) on the first persist.
- Memory paths are validated against `.`/`..` traversal and symlink escape. An unsafe or unresolvable scope is silently skipped rather than breaking the run.

Scopes:

- Project: resolves under `<project>/.pi/agent-memory/<path>` and travels with the repo.
- User: resolves under `~/.pi/agent/agent-memory/<path>` and is shared across projects for that agent.

## Refinement overlays

A refinement overlay is bounded, project-local guidance layered on top of one agent's system prompt without editing the agent file. Use it when an agent repeatedly stumbles on the same project-specific issue and recent run evidence shows what to correct.

```text
/subagents-refine reviewer
```

```ts
subagent({ action: "refine", agent: "reviewer" })
subagent({ action: "refine.show", agent: "reviewer" })
subagent({ action: "refine.rollback", agent: "reviewer" })
```

How it works:

- `refine` collects bounded evidence from that agent's recent runs in the project (statuses, errors, review findings, residual risks, output tails), then launches a fresh read-only proposal child to draft small guidance edits from that evidence.
- Proposed guidance is validated before it is written. Edits that try to override safety, policy, tool, output, acceptance, developer, or system instructions are rejected, as are edits that target all agents or base agent files.
- The accepted overlay is stored at `.pi/subagents/refinements/<agent>.md` with revision metadata and snapshots. Each `refine` or `refine.rollback` adds a snapshot, and `refine.rollback` restores the previous revision.
- At launch, the current overlay is injected into that agent's child system prompt as a `<pi-subagents-refinement>` block scoped to this project. The base agent definition is never modified.

`refine.show` prints the current overlay and revision history. Delete the overlay file to remove the refinement entirely.

## Tool and extension selection

How `tools` behaves:

- `tools` omitted: the child session gets Pi's normal builtin tools.
- `tools` present: regular tool names become an explicit allowlist.
- `tools:` empty: the child session gets no tools.
- `allowNestedSubagents: true`: explicitly enables child-safe nested fanout without turning omitted `tools` into an allowlist. Depth and inherited capability ceilings still apply.
- `allowedAgents: scout, reviewer`: if nesting is separately enabled, restricts this agent's descendant launches to those names. `allowedAgents:` denies all descendants and omission is unrestricted except for inherited/runtime policy.

`excludeTools` is applied after this resolution. It can narrow an explicit `tools` allowlist or, when `tools` is omitted, remove names from Pi's default builtin tool set. Runtime-injected tools are excluded only when their exact names are listed. An empty `excludeTools` list has no effect.

An allowlisted name does not load the extension that registers it. Load that provider through `extensions`, `subagentOnlyExtensions`, a path-like `tools` entry, or (background children only) normal Pi extension discovery.

Ambient extensions depend on where the child runs. Local foreground children are sessions inside the parent Pi process and never load the parent's ambient extensions; otherwise the parent would start a second copy of each ambient extension, including this one. Background children are sessions inside the detached runner process and load the ambient extensions unless the agent sets `extensions` or the capability ceiling denies extensions. Local foreground children do inherit the providers the parent's extensions registered (`pi.registerProvider`), so their models resolve without loading those extensions again. Pane-native remote foreground children instead use the remote machine's provider discovery and configuration. Agents that need MCP tools (`mcpDirectTools`, or MCP tools from an ambient adapter such as pi-mcp-adapter) must therefore run as background children (`async: true`). A foreground launch of such an agent fails with a diagnostic that says exactly that.

More rules:

- `mcp:` entries are split out and forwarded as direct MCP selections without granting normal builtins unless those builtins are also listed.
- Path-like `tools` entries, such as extension paths or `.ts`/`.js` files, are treated as tool-extension paths rather than tool names.
- Internal runtime tools such as `structured_output` are added to an explicit allowlist only when their contract is active.
- Unknown extension tool calls are treated as mutating diagnostic activity only when their names are listed in `mutationTools`.

Examples:

- `tools` omitted and `extensions` omitted: normal builtins; a background child also loads the ambient extensions.
- `tools: mcp:chrome-devtools`: only the resolved direct Chrome DevTools MCP tools.
- `tools: read, bash, mcp:chrome-devtools`: only `read` and `bash` as builtins, plus direct Chrome DevTools MCP tools.
- `tools: subagent, read`: a child-safe `subagent` tool is available inside that child so it can run explicitly assigned nested fanout.
- `allowNestedSubagents: true` with `tools` omitted: normal builtin tools (and, for background children, ambient extensions) remain inherited, and the child-safe nested `subagent` runtime is added.
- `tools: read, fixture_search` plus `subagentOnlyExtensions: ./tools/fixture-search.ts`: the provider loads only in this agent's child sessions, and the registered `fixture_search` name survives the strict allowlist.

Direct MCP tools require [pi-mcp-adapter](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter). Subagents only receive direct MCP tools when `mcp:` entries are listed in their frontmatter; global `directTools: true` in `mcp.json` is not enough by itself. The generic `mcp` proxy tool can still be used for discovery when available. The adapter caches tool metadata at startup, so after connecting a new MCP server for the first time, restart Pi before relying on direct tools. Server `includeTools` and `excludeTools` policies are enforced while resolving cached metadata for children: both accept exact names and `*`/`?` glob patterns against raw, generated-resource, and server/short/none-prefixed names, with `excludeTools` taking precedence. `mcp:` entries must name servers from the adapter's configuration files. A server that exists only in the adapter's runtime snapshot (registered at runtime, not persisted) cannot be provided to a child: children are pi sessions inside the parent or the runner process, not `pi` processes that could receive an MCP config argument, so such a launch fails with an error saying that MCP tools must come from an ambient adapter extension in a background child. An `mcp:` entry named `subagent` does not authorize nested fanout; declare the builtin `subagent` tool or set `allowNestedSubagents: true`. If a resolved direct MCP name is missing from the child registry, pi-subagents keeps the launch failed under the strict allowlist and identifies the condition as a host/pi-mcp-adapter registration problem; verify that the adapter registers the selected tools before child startup.

`extensions` controls child extension loading:

```yaml
# Omitted: all normal extensions load

# Empty: no extensions
extensions:

# Allowlist
extensions: /abs/path/to/ext-a.ts, /abs/path/to/ext-b.ts
```

When `extensions` is present, normal discovered extensions are disabled. The listed extensions, path-like `tools` entries, required pi-subagents runtime extensions, and `subagentOnlyExtensions` still load.

Use `subagentOnlyExtensions` when a custom extension tool should exist only inside child sessions. It is scoped by agent config: every run of that agent receives those extension paths, while other agents do not unless they declare the same field. The current model does not have a separate named-subagent audience inside one agent definition.

To apply a shared extension policy to every agent that does not declare its own, set `subagents.defaultExtensions` for an ambient-disabling allowlist or `subagents.defaultSubagentOnlyExtensions` for child-only paths that preserve ambient discovery (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)).

Before the first model turn, the child runtime compares every explicit tool name with Pi's final filtered registry. A missing provider fails the run with the unavailable names and concrete `subagentOnlyExtensions`/`extensions` guidance, instead of letting a direct or chained child silently continue without its requested tools.

## Skills

Skills are `SKILL.md` files made available to an agent. The prompt includes skill metadata and the file location; the agent reads the full skill file only when the task matches.

Discovery uses project-first precedence:

1. Project config `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (`.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` in standard Pi)
2. Project packages and project settings packages via `package.json -> pi.skills`
3. Current task cwd package via `package.json -> pi.skills`
4. Project config `settings.json -> skills`
5. `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
6. User packages and user settings packages via `package.json -> pi.skills`
7. `~/.pi/agent/settings.json -> skills`

Use agent defaults, override them at runtime, or disable them:

```ts
{ workflowScript: `return runs.run("main", { agent: "scout", task: "..." })` }
{ workflowScript: `return runs.run("main", { agent: "scout", task: "...", skill: "tmux, safe-bash" })` }
{ workflowScript: `return runs.run("main", { agent: "scout", task: "...", skill: false })` }
```

For chains, `skill` at the top level is additive. A step-level `skill` overrides that step; `false` disables skills for that step.

Available skills use this shape in the child prompt:

```xml
The following configured skills are available to this subagent.
Use the read tool to load a skill's file when the task matches its description.
When a skill file references a relative path, resolve it against the skill directory (parent of SKILL.md / dirname of the path) and use that absolute path in tool commands.

<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>safe-bash</name>
    <description>Run shell commands safely.</description>
    <location>/absolute/path/to/safe-bash/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

If an agent has an explicit `tools` allowlist and resolved skills, `read` is added for that child run so the listed skill files can be loaded on demand.

Missing skills do not fail execution. The result summary shows a warning.

Agent-local `skillPath` candidates never enter Pi's parent/global skills catalog. Pair `inheritSkills: false` with explicit `skills` and `skillPath` when a child should receive only its selected private skills.

## The bundled pi-subagents skill

The package bundles a `pi-subagents` skill that is automatically available to the parent agent when the extension is installed. Availability is not automatic routing or permission to delegate: the parent works directly unless the operator requests delegation in the current request or through applicable user/project instructions. Once authorized, use the smallest bounded child or workflow whose evidence, independent review, specialization, parallelism, or isolation benefit earns its overhead. It is for the orchestrating parent only: child subagents never receive it, and their context is explicitly filtered to strip parent-only orchestration instructions.

What it covers:

- **Delegation patterns**: how to select a bounded agent and single, parallel, scripted, or async shape after delegation is authorized, including fresh or forked context.
- **Prompt workflow recipes**: how to apply the packaged techniques directly with `subagent(...)` when the user describes the workflow in natural language instead of invoking a slash command. This includes parallel review, review-loop, parallel research, parallel context-build, parallel handoff-plan, gather-context-and-clarify, and parallel cleanup.
- **Role-agent prompting guidance**: compact contract prompts instead of long scripts, what to include in role-specific meta prompts, and retrieval budgets for researchers.
- **Safety boundaries**: child agents must not run subagents unless their resolved builtin tools explicitly include `subagent`, must not invent intercom targets, and must escalate unapproved decisions.
- **Intercom conventions**: when to ask vs send, and how parent-side supervisor/result delivery works through the native channel.
- **Control and diagnostics**: attention signals, soft interrupts, status, and the `doctor` action.

If you are writing an agent that has been asked to orchestrate subagents, the bundled skill helps it behave correctly without guessing the patterns. If you are a human user, you do not need to read it; the README and prompt shortcuts encode the same workflows in user-facing form.
