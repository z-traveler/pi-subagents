# Configuration

`pi-subagents` reads optional JSON config from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/config.json`. This page lists every key, plus the environment variables and the settings-file keys that affect config resolution.

Settings-level keys (`subagents.defaultModel`, `modelPools`, `defaultProvider`, `defaultThinking`, `defaultExtensions`, `defaultSubagentOnlyExtensions`, `agentOverrides`, `machines`, `agentScanDirs`, `agentExcludeDirs`, `modelScope`, `disableThinking`, `disableBuiltins`, watchdog settings) live in Pi settings files, not this config file. `modelScope.agents.<name>` adds per-agent restrictions, and `allow: ["inherit"]` permits the current parent model. See [models.md](models.md), [agents.md](agents.md), and [watchdog.md](watchdog.md).

## Project root resolution (settings)

By default, project settings resolve from the nearest parent directory that contains `.pi` or `.agents`, preserving existing nested-project behavior. Discovery stops at the user home directory, including when the home is reached through a filesystem alias such as a symlink or Windows junction, so home-level `.pi` and `.agents` remain user configuration rather than project configuration. In monorepos or git worktrees where an incidental nested `.pi` directory should not shadow the repository-level config, set this in the repository root `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "projectRootResolution": "git-root"
  }
}
```

`"git-root"` keeps package discovery, project agents, chains, and `agentOverrides` anchored to the git worktree root when that root also has Pi project config. A nested project can still opt back into nearest-root behavior by setting `"projectRootResolution": "nearest"` in its own `.pi/settings.json`.

## Extra agent scan directories (settings)

Add recursive user or project agent roots with `subagents.agentScanDirs` in Pi settings:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "agentScanDirs": ["~/.pi/flows/*/agents"]
  }
}
```

Entries support `~` expansion. A single `*` path segment expands one directory level, so package-like folders can each expose an `agents/` directory. Missing directories are ignored. Fixed user/project agent directories still win over same-name agents from scan roots.

## Excluded agent directories (settings)

Prune directory subtrees from recursive agent-definition discovery with `subagents.agentExcludeDirs`:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "agentExcludeDirs": ["~/.agents/plugins", "../.agents/plugins"]
  }
}
```

Entries are literal directory paths (no globs), supporting `~` and absolute paths. Relative paths resolve from the directory containing their settings file: the user agent config directory for user settings, or the project config directory (normally `.pi/`) for project settings. Thus `../.agents/plugins` in project `.pi/settings.json` excludes the project's legacy plugin subtree without excluding ordinary `.agents/*.md` agents.

User and nearest-project exclusions are combined for every discovery scope, including all-source diagnostics. They apply before traversal and definition reads; explicit scan roots, environment roots, and installed packages cannot re-include an excluded tree. Normalized and real-path containment also excludes symlink aliases without matching sibling directory prefixes. Settings changes invalidate cached discovery. Excluded agent trees are not fingerprinted; chain discovery keeps its own unchanged watches when it shares a directory. Skills, chains, and the extension's bundled builtin snapshot are outside this setting's scope.

## `modelResponseAliases`

In `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/config.json` (top-level, not under `subagents`):

```json
{
  "modelResponseAliases": {
    "databricks-bedrock/ias-claude-opus-5": ["claude-opus-5"]
  }
}
```

Optionally accept exact response model IDs for an exact provider-qualified launch. Keys use the resolved `provider/model` ID without its thinking suffix; values are arrays of non-empty response ID strings. Alias matching is exact and case-sensitive, with no fuzzy or suffix matching. Empty arrays add no accepted IDs; malformed declarations fail config loading.

This is your explicit assertion that the declared response IDs identify the requested model, not proof from model output. It does not rewrite the outgoing model or provider route, or bypass verification for other routes. Foreground and background runs capture this declaration for launch and retain it on revival, including when no aliases were declared. Changing config affects new independent runs, not the retained declaration. Without a matching declaration, existing strict verification remains unchanged.

For a native Pi `model_verification_failed` where your proxy accepts `claude-haiku-4-5` but reports `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`, independently confirm your proxy's mapping, then configure:

```json
{
  "modelResponseAliases": {
    "YOUR_PROVIDER/claude-haiku-4-5": ["anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0"]
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_PROVIDER` with the resolved Pi provider ID. Keep the outgoing model alias unchanged. This native remedy already exists in v0.65.1; it does not infer equivalence from provider prefixes or dates. The built-in external `claude-code` adapter does not invoke this verifier or use this setting. If an external run shows this diagnostic, identify the installed version, resolved runner kind/adapter, and error location before applying a native remedy. Thanks to [sixtus](https://github.com/sixtus) for the concrete request-ID/response-ID example in [#1922](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents/issues/1922).

## `toolDescriptionMode`

```json
{ "toolDescriptionMode": "compact" }
```

Controls the parent-facing `subagent` tool description registered at startup. The default registers the compact execution/safety description plus separate `promptSnippet` and `promptGuidelines`. That metadata explains use after operator-authorized delegation; it does not route ordinary work to children or independently authorize delegation. Explicit `"compact"` uses the same description without that extra metadata; `"full"` adds workflow and management detail, also without split metadata. All modes retain the same flat parameter schema. Extended examples and recipes are available on demand through `action:"guide"` and the bundled pi-subagents skill; full mode is not an exhaustive manual. Count the separate default metadata as well as the tool definition when comparing prompt footprints.

`custom` reads `subagent-tool-description.md` from the project config directory, then from `~/.pi/agent/subagent-tool-description.md`. Missing, empty, unreadable, or oversized custom files fall back to the full description. Custom templates may use `{{fullDescription}}`, `{{compactDescription}}`, `{{safetyGuidance}}`, `{{agentDir}}`, and `{{projectConfigDir}}`; the safety guidance is always present so custom prose cannot remove the runtime guardrails. Restart Pi after changing the mode or custom file.

## `inlineToolDisplay`

```json
{ "inlineToolDisplay": "summary" }
```

Controls the `subagent` tool result shown inline in chat. The default, `"rich"`, shows live child activity and expands to detailed output. `"summary"` keeps the inline result at one stable row for running, completed, failed, stopped, and paused runs; it does not animate, show elapsed time, preview child output, or change when Pi's expand key is pressed. FleetView remains available for live progress and detailed inspection.

This is one result row **per tool call**, not one panel per run; the call heading remains. Separate `status` calls for the same run remain separate historical transcript entries. Summary mode neither merges those calls nor changes cross-extension ordering. For a compact chat plus one live editor surface, see [Reducing status display noise](observability.md#reducing-status-display-noise).

## `mainWindowRenderer`

```json
{
  "mainWindowRenderer": {
    "horizontalSpacing": 0,
    "compactResultMaxLines": 4
  }
}
```

Controls only the main chat `subagent` call/result renderer. It does not change child execution, orchestration, FleetView, artifacts, transcripts, or model-facing content.

`horizontalSpacing` is an integer from `0` to `4`. The default preserves current spacing. Set it to `0` to remove the extra spaces before compact result details and between parts of the call row.

`compactResultMaxLines` is a positive integer. It caps only collapsed rich-result rows and adds an expand hint when rows are hidden. Expanded output remains uncapped.

With `"summary"`, a tool result looks like this:

```text
✓ reviewer · completed
```

## `foregroundDetachShortcut`

```json
{ "foregroundDetachShortcut": "ctrl+b" }
```

Optionally binds a shortcut that detaches the active foreground single-subagent run without terminating it. The running foreground card shows the configured shortcut beside its live-detail hint. The default is unset, so pi-subagents does not reserve a global key.

Pi binds `Ctrl+B` to editor cursor-left by default. The extension shortcut takes precedence, but Pi reports the conflict at startup. To reserve the key without that warning, override the editor action in `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "tui.editor.cursorLeft": "left"
}
```

## `orcaProgressTabs` (experimental)

```json
{
  "orcaProgressTabs": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Opt in to a best-effort Orca observer that creates one Orca terminal tab for each top-level subagent call and mirrors the run's live tool and assistant progress. Parallel and chain children share that one tab, with child section headers in the mirrored log. Tab titles use a persistent worktree-local sequence (`subagents · <run-label> · 1`, `... · 2`, and so on), so separate top-level calls do not reuse the same number. For the same worktree, `orca terminal create` runs one at a time in that sequence so observer tabs appear from left to right as `1`, then `2`, then `3`. This does **not** replace Pi as the runner: native Pi children keep the same lifecycle, status, control, artifact, and result paths. External CLI profiles also keep their existing runner and can mirror their stdout/stderr.

The integration is off by default and supports macOS and Linux. It is disabled on Windows. When enabled, `pi-subagents` looks for executable `orca` on `PATH`, or uses the executable path in `PI_SUBAGENT_ORCA_BINARY`. If no executable is available, Orca is not running, the cwd is not an Orca-managed worktree, or `terminal create` fails, the authoritative subagent still runs normally. Tab creation is deliberately best-effort and never changes the child result. A passive observer manifest is also written under `<worktree>/.pi/subagents/views/orca/` when possible so future view surfaces can discover the Orca tab without making Orca authoritative.

Set `enabled` to `false` (or remove the block) as a kill switch. In that state, `pi-subagents` does not invoke `orca` and creates no Orca tabs. The temporary mirror files contain child output, use private file modes where supported, and are removed shortly after the run finishes. Each mirror is capped at 1 MiB. The observer stops accepting progress when the cap or stream backpressure is reached and appends a truncation notice. The viewer removes terminal control sequences with parser state that persists across file reads. On completion, the viewer exits back to the Orca terminal's shell prompt; the tab and its terminal scrollback remain open until the user closes the tab. A successfully completed native Pi run with a recorded session ends with a safely quoted `rm -- <exact-session-path>` command; failed, stopped, timed-out, and sessionless runs do not show the removal command.

## `asyncByDefault`

```json
{ "asyncByDefault": false }
```

WorkflowScript calls use background execution when the request omits `async`. Set `asyncByDefault` to `false` to restore foreground-by-default behavior for tool launches that still use the internal single-run primitive. Callers can still force foreground with `async: false` unless `forceTopLevelAsync` is enabled.

## `defaultSubagentContext`

```json
{ "defaultSubagentContext": "fresh" }
```

Sets `fresh` or `fork` for every subagent launch that omits `context`. This global preference replaces each agent-level `defaultContext`. Explicit `context: "fresh"` or `context: "fork"` still wins.

With `"fork"`, the setting uses the existing implicit-fork behavior. A launch starts fresh when the parent session file or current leaf is not available. `"fresh"` starts fresh even when the selected agent defaults to fork. Scheduled runs continue to set fresh context explicitly. A runner or provider that does not support fork context keeps its existing rejection behavior.

## `forkContext`

```json
{
  "forkContext": {
    "mode": "pruned",
    "model": "openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna:max"
  }
}
```

Controls how resolved fork launches prepare the inherited session. The default `"full"` mode keeps the complete fork. `"pruned"` mode keeps inherited context exact while it fits the code-owned 64 KiB session budget. On overflow, the required `model` returns short JSON summaries keyed by stable item ids. Tool results spill first, then older assistant and tool context, and user text only when required. It applies to explicit `context: "fork"`, global and agent fork defaults, and `context: "profile"` when the selected profile resolves to fork.

Child-visible spilled items contain only the model summary and a stable `{ batchId, itemId }` recovery ref. Raw bodies and their digests, source entry ids, labels, sizes, and tool metadata go to a private `0600` sidecar next to the child session. This release does not add a recovery command or expose that payload to the child model.

Pruned forks keep the normal `parentSession` link, child cwd alignment, and fork thinking-block sanitization (signed Anthropic thinking blocks are stripped; the child keeps its requested thinking level). Missing model or auth, invalid or incomplete summary JSON, budget overflow, recovery validation failure, and raw overflow leakage all stop the launch before child spawn. The extension never falls back to a full fork or refs-only context after a prune failure.

## `fleetView`

```json
{ "fleetView": false }
```

Controls the persistent, navigable FleetView. The default is `true`. Set it to `false` to hide FleetView without disabling status tracking, completion notifications, `/subagents-fleet`, or lifecycle events.

## `fleetViewPlacement`

```json
{ "fleetViewPlacement": "aboveEditor" }
```

Places the persistent FleetView either `"belowEditor"` or `"aboveEditor"`. The default is `"belowEditor"`; invalid values fall back to `"belowEditor"`.

## `fleetKeybindings`

```json
{
  "fleetKeybindings": {
    "pageUp": ["u"],
    "pageDown": ["d"],
    "selectFirst": ["g"],
    "selectLast": ["G"]
  }
}
```

Customizes only the full Fleet inspector opened by `/subagents-fleet` or FleetView inspection. It does not change Pi's global keybindings or the compact persistent FleetView.

Each action accepts a non-empty array of key strings. Configured actions replace their defaults. Unset actions keep the defaults: `selectUp` is `up`/`k`, `selectDown` is `down`/`j`, `scrollUp` is `K`, `scrollDown` is `J`, `pageUp` is `pageUp`, `pageDown` is `pageDown`, `selectFirst` is `home`, `selectLast` is `end`, `toggleTools` is `x`/`X`/`ctrl+o`, `refresh` is `r`/`R`, `steer` is `s`, `stop` is `D`, `inspect` is `H`, and `close` is `escape`/`ctrl+c`/`q`.

Prompt modes keep their fixed keys. For example, `Esc` still cancels steer text or stop confirmation even when the Fleet-level close binding is changed.

## `asyncWidget`

```json
{ "asyncWidget": true }
```

Controls the under-editor widget for active background runs. It defaults to `true`, including when FleetView is enabled, so active work remains visible after reload. Set it to `false` to hide this widget while keeping FleetView available.

## `waitTool`

```json
{ "waitTool": { "enabled": true, "defaultTimeoutMs": 120000 } }
```

`defaultTimeoutMs` sets the blocking window used when a `bg_wait` call omits `timeoutMs`; explicit call values win, followed by this setting, then the 30-minute fallback. `bg_wait` is the only registered wait tool. When the window elapses, the tool returns a non-error `window_elapsed` result with the still-active work identities, and that work keeps running. Set `enabled` to `false` to make direct calls return immediately instead of blocking. The default is enabled. You can also set `"waitTool": false`; set `PI_SUBAGENT_WAIT_TOOL_ENABLED=false` (or `0`, `off`, `disabled`) to override config for one process. The effective enabled and default-timeout values are passed explicitly to child runtimes. Headless `agent_end` auto-drain retains its own strict deadline and fails if required work remains unresolved. Invalid config or environment values fail instead of being coerced.

Blocking `bg_wait({ id: "..." })` keeps the current tool call open until that run changes. By default it returns when a run needs attention. Use `bg_wait({ stopOnAttention: false })` only for run-to-completion flows that should wait through idle or long-thinking attention; supervisor/contact requests still stop the wait. In a long-lived interactive parent session, `bg_wait({ id: "...", nonBlocking: true })` instead resolves the prefix once, persists the exact run identity, returns a subscription token immediately, and wakes that session on completion, failure, attention, reconciliation failure, or timeout. Use it for provider, detached, or other background work without a native completion notification; ordinary async subagent runs notify the parent natively and do not need a wait subscription. Armed subscriptions appear in ordinary `subagent({ action: "status" })` output and are not counted as active child work.

This is different from `waitTool.enabled=false`, which returns immediately without registering any future wake. Provider items remain available only to blocking fleet-wide waits; non-blocking subscriptions require one async or remembered detached foreground run id.

## `resultScanLogging`

```json
{ "resultScanLogging": "activity" }
```

Controls how slow result-index scans are logged. Defaults to `"activity"`; valid values are `"all"`, `"activity"`, and `"off"`.

The watcher logs `Subagent result scan inspected … scheduled …` through `console.error` whenever a result-index scan passes the slow threshold (500ms). With `"activity"` (default), it logs only scans that inspected or scheduled actual work. Use `"all"` to log every slow scan, including the periodic healthy rescan that inspects zero files while no async runs are pending, or `"off"` to silence slow-scan logging entirely. `"off"` does not disable result delivery or the watcher itself, only its slow-scan log line.

## `forceTopLevelAsync`

```json
{ "forceTopLevelAsync": true }
```

Forces depth-0 internal single, parallel, and chain runs into background mode and bypasses launch UI by forcing `clarify: false`. Nested calls keep their own inherited settings.

## `timeoutMs`

```json
{ "timeoutMs": 3600000 }
```

Global default runtime deadline, in milliseconds, for subagent runs. It replaces the built-in 30-minute backstop for foreground launches (single, parallel, chain, and workflowScript) and plain single-agent async runs whenever no call-level `timeoutMs`/`maxRuntimeMs` applies. For single-agent launches, selected agent frontmatter `timeoutMs` still wins. This only moves the *default*. Expiring this run-level deadline is terminal.

This deadline bounds the whole run. The wait for a single model response is bounded separately by Pi's `httpIdleTimeoutMs` setting (default 300000; `0` disables it), which Pi applies both as the SDK request timeout and as the undici header/body idle timeout. Detached async runners read the same setting from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and the project `.pi/settings.json` for their own HTTP dispatcher, so a local model that queues or prefills for longer than five minutes needs `httpIdleTimeoutMs` raised or disabled in Pi settings, plus a `timeoutMs` long enough for the run.

Use it when foreground orchestration or plain async single-agent runs need a longer default than 30 minutes. It does not set async composite top-level deadlines, and it does not replace async fan-out child deadlines.

Composite async runs (async chains, parallel tasks, and scripted workflows) stay unbounded at the top level by design. Their runner children are bounded individually by their own agent or runner defaults, so this value does not cap them. Must be a positive integer no greater than `2147483647` (the largest delay a Node.js timer can honor, roughly 24.8 days); invalid or out-of-range values are ignored and the built-in defaults apply.

## `toolTimeoutMs`

```json
{ "toolTimeoutMs": 600000 }
```

Optional hard per-tool-call deadline in milliseconds. When configured, a child that emits `tool_execution_start` but not `tool_execution_end` is terminated with `timedOut: true` and a tool-specific error. The effective value is resolved per child: explicit `subagent` call value, then agent frontmatter, then this config value, then `PI_SUBAGENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`.

Without a configured value, Pi still applies a five-minute hard timeout to known-fast built-in tools: `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `edit`, `write`, and `structured_output`. Long-running tools such as `bash`, custom tools, and MCP tools do not get a hard default. They get the normal open-tool attention notice after `activeNoticeAfterMs` and remain bounded by the run-level deadline.

The tool timer tracks each active `toolCallId` separately and never extends the run-level deadline: when the remaining run budget is shorter, the ordinary run-level timeout wins. `contact_supervisor`, `intercom`, and `bg_wait` are exempt because their legitimate purpose can be to wait for a human, supervisor, or background run. Use hard tool timeouts only for wedge protection; an elapsed timeout is not a mutation-safe boundary. Configured values must be positive integers no greater than `2147483647`; invalid or out-of-range values are rejected with a visible error rather than silently ignored.

## `checkpointBeforeDeadlineMs`

```json
{ "checkpointBeforeDeadlineMs": 300000 }
```

Global default for the async single-agent `checkpointBeforeDeadlineMs` launch option. When an async single-agent run has a run-level deadline, the runner issues a best-effort "checkpoint and stop" steer to the child this many milliseconds before that deadline: finish the current tool call, report changed files, build/test state, remaining work, and commit/PR state, and start no new work. The steer uses the normal steering lifecycle at the child's next tool boundary, so its receipt (requested, routed, delivered) is visible in run status and events, and the ordinary `timeoutMs` kill still applies if the child does not stop.

An explicit `subagent` call value wins over this default. Choose a value at least as long as the child's longest expected tool call; a steer cannot land inside one. When the deadline leaves less than one second of run time before the checkpoint, the checkpoint is disarmed and the run behaves as if the option were absent. The global config value must be a positive integer no greater than `2147483647`; invalid values fail config loading rather than silently disabling the checkpoint.

## `globalConcurrencyLimit`

```json
{ "globalConcurrencyLimit": 20 }
```

Caps simultaneously running children inside one run, including durable legacy multi-child runs and `workflowScript` launches through `runs.run`/`runs.all`. Queued workflow children retain their stable keys and begin when a running sibling releases capacity. The default is `20`.

Inline or file-backed top-level workflow calls may set a positive safe-integer `globalConcurrencyLimit` to override this value for that workflow. The override is workflow-only and is not forwarded to child calls.

## `maxSubagentSpawnsPerSession`

```json
{ "maxSubagentSpawnsPerSession": 100 }
```

Optionally caps the total number of child subagent launches during one parent session, including completed and failed children, parallel task counts, static chain steps, and bounded dynamic fanout children. Sessions are unlimited by default. Set this value to `0` to disable a configured cap. `PI_SUBAGENT_MAX_SPAWNS_PER_SESSION` overrides the config for a process and follows the same positive-cap/zero-unlimited semantics.

`subagent({ action: "status" })`, fleet status, and `subagent({ action: "doctor" })` expose used, effective limit, remaining capacity, grants, and the remaining grant allowance for this budget. A user may explicitly call `subagent({ action: "grant-spawn-budget", additional: 10 })` from the root interactive parent after all children settle and confirm the native prompt. Grants are additive: they never erase cumulative usage, are rejected for unlimited sessions and child/headless callers, and total granted capacity cannot exceed the original configured cap. Compaction remains part of the same logical parent session and does not reset usage or grants; starting a new parent session does.

## `maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun`

```json
{ "maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun": 64 }
```

Caps cumulative logical child admissions in one top-level run tree. The default is `64`. `PI_SUBAGENT_MAX_SPAWNS_PER_RUN` overrides the config when it is a positive integer. Invalid, zero, or missing values fall back to the configured positive value or `64`.

Inline or file-backed top-level workflow calls may set a positive safe-integer `maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun`; it overrides the environment and config for that workflow. Inherited nested budgets remain authoritative, and the override is not forwarded to child calls.

The budget counts single launches, expanded `tasks`/`count`, static chain steps and parallel groups, actual dynamic `expand` items, appended chain steps, workflow children, and nested child calls. Static and materialized dynamic groups are admitted atomically. Retained-child resume reuses the original logical child claim. Claims are never released or refunded. This cap is independent from the session-wide cumulative spawn budget and `globalConcurrencyLimit`.

## `maxActiveAsyncRunsPerSession`

```json
{ "maxActiveAsyncRunsPerSession": 4 }
```

Optionally caps concurrently active top-level async runs owned by one parent session. Unset or `0` keeps the existing unlimited behavior. A positive integer reserves one slot before an async single, parallel, chain, or workflow creates run artifacts or starts children. Foreground runs and nested/workflow children do not reserve another slot.

Queued, running, paused, and needs-attention runs retain capacity. Runner-backed slots release only after terminal logical state and matching observed process-terminal proof from #1030. Missing, malformed, or unknown cleanup proof retains the slot. A terminal async workflow releases after its controller is gone and every launched child is accounted for: awaited foreground children are covered by workflow settlement, while actual background children still require observed process-terminal proof. Resume transfers the source slot without a second charge. Dismissal and history cleanup do not release capacity.

When the runner is gone but process cleanup proof remains unknown, configure a bounded policy reclaim under `capacity.abandonedSlotReleaseAfterMs`:

```json
{ "maxActiveAsyncRunsPerSession": 4, "capacity": { "abandonedSlotReleaseAfterMs": 1200000 } }
```

The default is `1200000` milliseconds (20 minutes). The policy releases only a failed terminal run whose runner PID is dead and whose last activity is older than the threshold. A live or unknown PID, a non-failed terminal state, a recent run, or missing activity timestamp retains the slot. Set the value to `false` to keep strict retention. Valid configured durations range from 5 minutes through 24 hours. Policy release is reported as `abandoned-timeout` with `processProof: unknown`; it is not observed process-terminal proof and may reclaim capacity while an orphan child still exists.

This limit bounds current top-level async load. It is separate from cumulative `maxSubagentSpawnsPerSession`, `maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun`, and `globalConcurrencyLimit`.

`subagent({ action: "status" })`, fleet status, and `subagent({ action: "doctor" })` expose used, effective limit, and remaining active capacity. Static chains and parallel calls fail before creating run artifacts or starting partial work when their declared capacity cannot fit. Later retries or unbounded dynamic work are not guaranteed by that preflight.

## `scheduledRuns`

```json
{ "scheduledRuns": { "enabled": false, "maxPending": 20 } }
```

Durable schedules are enabled by default and stored per project under `.pi/subagents/schedules/<id>/`. See [missions.md](missions.md#schedules) for usage.

Set `storeRoot` to keep durable schedules outside project repositories. It must be an absolute path or a `~/` path, which expands from the user home directory. Each project is stored under a hash of its resolved working directory, so projects do not share schedules.

```json
{ "scheduledRuns": { "storeRoot": "~/.local/share/pi-subagents/schedules" } }
```

When `storeRoot` is omitted, schedules remain at `<cwd>/.pi/subagents/schedules`.

## `parallel`

```json
{
  "parallel": {
    "maxTasks": 12,
    "concurrency": 6
  }
}
```

`maxTasks` defaults to `8`; `concurrency` defaults to `4`. Per-call `concurrency` takes precedence.

## `defaultSessionDir`

```json
{ "defaultSessionDir": "~/.pi/agent/sessions/subagent/" }
```

Session directory precedence is: `params.sessionDir`, then `config.defaultSessionDir`, then a directory derived from the parent session. Sessions are always enabled.

## `singleRunOutputBaseDir`

```json
{ "singleRunOutputBaseDir": "~/.pi/subagent-outputs" }
```

Routes relative `output` paths for single-agent `/run` calls under this directory. Absolute per-call or agent output paths are still used as-is. When unset, relative single-run outputs go under the run's output artifact directory instead of the project root.

## `maxSubagentDepth`

```json
{ "maxSubagentDepth": 1 }
```

Controls nested delegation when no stricter limit is inherited from the launching child's runtime config. Per-agent `maxSubagentDepth` can tighten the limit for that agent's child runs, but cannot relax an inherited stricter limit. This applies even to children that explicitly declare `tools: subagent` or `allowNestedSubagents: true`; at the cap, execution fanout is blocked instead of silently hiding nested work.

## `PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY`

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY=/path/to/pi-or-wrapper
```

Overrides the `pi` command pi-subagents spawns for project panes and the profile model probe. On a supported Bun-compiled Pi host it also selects the detached background host executable. That executable must accept Pi's bootstrap arguments and supply its compatible embedded SDK and adjacent release resources; bare Bun is not a substitute. Empty or whitespace-only values are ignored. Failed launches are not retried with another runtime.

Foreground children remain sessions inside the parent. Npm background children retain their Node runner and host-package peer aliases; this variable does not turn npm Pi into a binary-backed runner. See [Standalone background execution](standalone-background.md) for the official tested target.

## `PI_SUBAGENTS_PI_CODING_AGENT_PACKAGE_ROOT`

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENTS_PI_CODING_AGENT_PACKAGE_ROOT=/path/to/pi-coding-agent-package
```

Overrides host-package discovery for spawned children. Foreground CLI resolution uses this root to locate the `pi` CLI script, and the detached background runner uses it for jiti host resolution and peer-package aliases, so both child kinds agree on one host. It is consulted when argv-based automatic discovery cannot identify the host, such as a wrapper install or a non-standard layout. The value must be the root of a canonical `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` installation (the directory containing its `package.json`, with that package name); both child kinds still validate the package name and its peer packages from that install tree, so a package whose manifest carries a different name is rejected even with the override set. Empty or whitespace-only values are ignored.

The default in-process child session loader consults the same discovery. Before falling back to a bare `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` import, it resolves the host package root (the running pi process's location, then this override, then pi-subagents' own install tree as a last fallback) and imports the host's entry file directly, so children share the host's single SDK instance instead of a second copy. Roots whose `package.json` name is not `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` are rejected. When this override is selected, an unimportable root is reported instead of falling back to a bare import from a different tree.

## `intercomBridge`

```json
{
  "intercomBridge": {
    "mode": "always",
    "instructionFile": "./intercom-bridge.md",
    "resultDelivery": true
  }
}
```

Controls whether subagents receive runtime coordination instructions and whether `contact_supervisor` is auto-added to their tool allowlist when needed.

Fields:

- `mode`: default `always`; use `fork-only` to inject only for forked runs, or `off` to disable the bridge.
- `instructionFile`: optional Markdown template replacing the default bridge instructions. `{orchestratorTarget}` is interpolated with the parent session target. Relative paths resolve from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/`. The default template does not name the session, because `contact_supervisor` resolves it from the child runtime config; a template that does name it ties `launchContractDigest` to the parent session, and launch-contract preflight then needs `orchestratorTarget` to match.
- `resultDelivery`: default `false`; set `true` only when an external listener consumes `subagent:result-intercom` and acknowledges the grouped completion payload. This is optional external result delivery, not native supervisor messaging. Enabled delivery waits for acknowledgement and reports acknowledgement failures. It does not change supervisor asks or progress updates.

Bridge activation requires a targetable current parent session id, which `pi-subagents` passes to children automatically. Native supervisor messaging does not require an external `pi-intercom` installation or per-agent extension allowlists: children use `contact_supervisor`, and parents use `subagent_supervisor` to inspect or reply. Agents can still use an external `intercom` tool when they explicitly request a provider that supplies it.

The default injected guidance tells children to use `contact_supervisor` with `reason: "need_decision"` when blocked or needing a decision, `reason: "progress_update"` only for meaningful blocked/progress updates, and avoid routine completion handoffs.

## `worktreeBaseDir`

```json
{ "worktreeBaseDir": "/Users/matt/code/.worktrees/pi-subagents" }
```

Sets the native dedicated root directory for `worktree: true` runs. Relative paths resolve from the repository root, `~/...` expands to your home directory, and `PI_SUBAGENTS_WORKTREE_DIR` is used when config is unset. When native allocation is used and both are unset, the dedicated root defaults to `{dirname(repoRoot)}/worktrees`, a `worktrees` directory alongside the repository checkout.

Each native worktree leaf is `{dedicatedRoot}/{projectName}/pi-worktree-{runId}-{index}`, where `{projectName}` is the repository directory name (`basename(repoRoot)`), `{runId}` identifies the run, and `{index}` counts the children within the run. `worktreeBaseDir` and `PI_SUBAGENTS_WORKTREE_DIR` override only the dedicated root; the `{projectName}/pi-worktree-{runId}-{index}` nesting under it always applies for native allocation. Unsafe locations are rejected instead of created: setup fails when the dedicated root sits inside the repository checkout or the Pi extensions directory, or when a worktree would land directly inside the repository parent.

## `worktreeProvider`

```json
{ "worktreeProvider": "auto", "worktreeBranchPrefix": "pi-subagents/" }
```

Selects the managed worktree allocator: `auto` (the default) uses Worktrunk when its machine-readable interface is available and otherwise falls back to Pi's native Git worktrees; `native` always uses Pi's Git implementation; and `worktrunk` fails closed when Worktrunk is unavailable or incompatible. On Windows, pi-subagents invokes Worktrunk through `git wt` to avoid Windows Terminal's conflicting `wt.exe` alias. A configured `worktreeBaseDir` (or `PI_SUBAGENTS_WORKTREE_DIR`) selects native allocation and cannot be combined with explicit `worktrunk`.

`worktreeBranchPrefix` is normalized as a Git ref namespace and defaults to `pi-subagents/`. Branch names include readable task/lane identity plus run and fan-out indexes. Pi continues to own setup hooks, launch, handoff/diff evidence, resume, and cleanup; Worktrunk is used only to allocate and report the worktree path.

Set `worktree` to `true` to make managed worktree isolation the default for launches that omit the per-call `worktree` flag. A per-call value still takes precedence.

## `worktreeSetupHook`

```json
{
  "worktreeSetupHook": "./scripts/setup-worktree.mjs",
  "worktreeSetupHookTimeoutMs": 45000
}
```

The hook runs once per created worktree. Paths must be absolute, `~/...`, or repo-relative; bare command names are rejected.

Setup command waits are nonblocking and cancellable through existing run controls. Existing run deadlines and the hook timeout still apply; there is no new setup timeout or configuration.

Setup commands, including Git hooks, must be finite and await all descendants before reporting success; do not start background services. Exit zero, natural pipe closure, complete bounded output, and valid JSON/path metadata are trusted completion for launch and cleanup—not observed process-tree proof. Violations are unsupported: protection against deleting a worktree with an undisclosed live descendant is not guaranteed. No additional Windows containment guarantee is provided.

stdin is a JSON object with `repoRoot`, `worktreePath`, `agentCwd`, `branch`, `index`, `runId`, and `baseCommit`. stdout must be one JSON object, for example:

```json
{ "syntheticPaths": [".venv", ".env.local"] }
```

`syntheticPaths` must be relative to the worktree root. They are removed before diff capture so helper files do not pollute patches. Tracked files are never excluded; marking a tracked path as synthetic fails setup. Default timeout is `30000` ms.

## `missions`

```json
{
  "missions": {
    "enabled": true,
    "globalIndex": true,
    "retainTerminal": 200
  }
}
```

Automatic missions are enabled by default for ordinary launches with a task. Use per-launch `mission: false` for intentionally ephemeral work, or set `enabled: false` to disable automatic creation globally; explicit mission actions and `missionId`/`mission` launch fields still work.

- Mission records default to a project-keyed directory under pi's agent directory (`~/.pi/agent/missions/projects/<project-hash>/`). This keeps the project worktree clean.
- `directory` may be absolute, `~/...`, or project-relative. Set it to `.pi/subagents/missions` to opt in to project-scoped records.
- `retainTerminal` is a positive count (default `200`); pruning removes only the oldest completed, failed, or cancelled records and their pointers, never planned, active, waiting, needs-decision, or corrupt records.
- The user-global index contains pointers only; missing-record pointers self-heal when globally listed. Set `globalIndex: false` to disable writes or `globalIndexDir` to redirect it.

## `authorityPolicy`

```json
{
  "authorityPolicy": {
    "discardWorktree": "confirm",
    "destructiveCleanup": "confirm",
    "spawnBudgetGrant": "confirm",
    "scheduleCreate": "auto",
    "stopRun": "auto",
    "steerRun": "auto",
    "inspectorOpen": "auto",
    "projectOpen": "confirm"
  }
}
```

Each fixed action resolves to `"auto"`, `"confirm"`, or `"forbid"`. This is intentionally a small action map, not a generic policy language. Confirm-required control actions fail closed without an interactive UI.

`inspectorOpen` and `projectOpen` cover the `inspector.open` and `project.open` tool actions, which launch an external inspector host or a Herdr project pane. `inspector.open` only reaches a plugin that reports itself available, so it defaults to `"auto"`; `project.open` runs `herdr` (or `HERDR_BIN`) with no such check and opens a pane that hosts its own Pi session, so it defaults to `"confirm"`. Set `"projectOpen": "auto"` to restore the previous unprompted behavior. The policy applies to the tool actions; opening an inspector from the fleet TUI is already an explicit operator keypress and is unaffected.

## `artifactDir`

```json
{ "artifactDir": "session" }
```

Controls where subagent artifact files (inputs, outputs, transcripts, metadata) are stored:

- `"project"`: writes to `<cwd>/.pi/subagents/artifacts/`.
- `"session"` (default): stores artifacts under pi's session directory (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/<session>/subagent-artifacts/`), keeping the working directory clean. It falls back to the OS temp directory when no session file exists.
- `"temp"`: uses the OS temp directory.

This preference also controls the default workflow artifact directory used by scripted chaining. `"project"` uses `<cwd>/.pi/subagents/chain-runs/`; the directory keeps its legacy name for compatibility. The default `"session"` and `"temp"` use the user-scoped temp workflow artifact directory.

The `"session"` option uses the same directory that `cleanupAllArtifactDirs` already scans for age-based cleanup, so artifacts are still cleaned up automatically. Temporary workflow artifact directories are cleaned up separately after 24 hours.

When a project-scoped launch runs from an npm package directory, pi-subagents warns if package settings can include `.pi/subagents/` in the published package. Add `.pi/subagents/` to `.npmignore` (or `.gitignore` when no `.npmignore` exists), use a `files` allowlist that does not include `.pi/subagents/`, or select `"session"` or `"temp"`.

## `completionBatch`

```json
{
  "completionBatch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "debounceMs": 150,
    "maxWaitMs": 1000,
    "stragglerDebounceMs": 75,
    "stragglerMaxWaitMs": 400,
    "stragglerWindowMs": 2000
  }
}
```

Controls smart batching of async-completion notifications. When several background subagents finish within a short window, their successful completions are held briefly and delivered as a single quiet grouped completion instead of separate completions.

- A hard `maxWaitMs` cap (measured from the first completion in a group) guarantees nothing is held indefinitely.
- Late-finishing siblings that arrive within `stragglerWindowMs` of a group emit join a shorter straggler group governed by `stragglerDebounceMs` and `stragglerMaxWaitMs`.
- Failed and paused completions bypass batching and fire immediately, flushing any held successes first, so failure and needs-attention signals are never delayed.
- Set `enabled` to `false` to restore the original one-notification-per-completion behavior. Changes apply on the next session start.

## `permissions`

Native child tool permission rules. See [watchdog.md](watchdog.md#native-child-tool-permissions).

## `PI_SUBAGENT_CACHE_RETENTION`

Sets the prompt-cache retention tier for child sessions, overriding `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` for children only. Environment-only; there is no config key. Accepts the same values Pi accepts, normally `short` or `long`.

Anthropic prices a cache write by the retention it is asked for: the 1h tier costs more per write than the 5m one. A parent that keeps a long-lived conversation earns that back by surviving idle gaps, but children are short-lived and rarely idle long enough to claim the longer window, so on a wide fanout the higher write price is paid without the benefit:

```text
PI_CACHE_RETENTION=long PI_SUBAGENT_CACHE_RETENTION=short
```

Unset by default, so children inherit the parent's retention and behaviour is unchanged unless you opt in. Both spawned children (through the launch environment) and in-process children (through the session's own stream function) honour it; the in-process path scopes the value per session rather than mutating `process.env`, so a child cannot change retention for a parent turn streaming at the same time.

Provider-reported `cacheWrite1h` usage confirms which tier a request used: it matches `cacheWrite` on the 1h tier and is `0` on the short one.

## `PI_SUBAGENT_FS_RETRY_MAX_TOTAL_MS`

Caps the total time a single retried filesystem operation may sleep, in milliseconds. Environment-only; there is no config key.

Atomic status and result writes retry on `EACCES`, `EBUSY`, and `EPERM`, which on Windows are usually a scanner or a sibling process holding the destination of a rename for a moment. The retry ladder sleeps up to about 7.9s in total, and it sleeps *synchronously* — `Atomics.wait` parks the calling thread rather than spinning.

That is the right trade-off for a CLI. It is the wrong one for a long-lived process that loads `pi-subagents` in-process and runs those writers on its event loop: one contended rename stalls everything it serves for the length of the ladder, and because the thread is parked rather than busy, it presents as an unresponsive process sitting at 0% CPU. A wide fanout makes contention on a single `status.json` likely.

Set this to bound that stall. The ladder keeps its number of attempts and only the sleeps shrink, because `run-fanout-budget` and mission state locking use the ladder's length as their attempt budget:

```text
PI_SUBAGENT_FS_RETRY_MAX_TOTAL_MS=1000
```

Unset by default, so behaviour is unchanged unless you opt in. Opting in trades lock-wait tolerance for responsiveness: entries clamped to `0` return immediately, so contention that would previously have been waited out surfaces as an error sooner. Values that are not a non-negative integer fail instead of being coerced.
