# Configuration

`pi-subagents` reads optional JSON config from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/config.json`. This page lists every key, plus the environment variables and the settings-file keys that affect config resolution.

Settings-level keys (`subagents.defaultModel`, `modelPools`, `defaultThinking`, `defaultExtensions`, `agentOverrides`, `modelScope`, `disableThinking`, `disableBuiltins`, watchdog settings) live in Pi settings files, not this config file. See [models.md](models.md), [agents.md](agents.md), and [watchdog.md](watchdog.md).

## Project root resolution (settings)

By default, project settings resolve from the nearest parent directory that contains `.pi` or `.agents`, preserving existing nested-project behavior. In monorepos or git worktrees where an incidental nested `.pi` directory should not shadow the repository-level config, set this in the repository root `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "projectRootResolution": "git-root"
  }
}
```

`"git-root"` keeps package discovery, project agents, chains, and `agentOverrides` anchored to the git worktree root when that root also has Pi project config. A nested project can still opt back into nearest-root behavior by setting `"projectRootResolution": "nearest"` in its own `.pi/settings.json`.

## `toolDescriptionMode`

```json
{ "toolDescriptionMode": "compact" }
```

Controls the parent-facing `subagent` tool description registered at startup. `full` is the default. `compact` keeps the execution modes, async/`subagent_wait` guidance, child-safety boundary, management/action split, one-writer review guidance, and artifact/status essentials with less prompt bloat.

`custom` reads `subagent-tool-description.md` from the project config directory, then from `~/.pi/agent/subagent-tool-description.md`. Missing, empty, unreadable, or oversized custom files fall back to the full description. Custom templates may use `{{fullDescription}}`, `{{compactDescription}}`, `{{safetyGuidance}}`, `{{agentDir}}`, and `{{projectConfigDir}}`; the safety guidance is always present so custom prose cannot remove the runtime guardrails. Restart Pi after changing the mode or custom file.

## `legacyChainControls`

```json
{ "legacyChainControls": true }
```

Defaults to `false`. The default registered model-facing tool schema and description omit the legacy `append-step` `step` schema and legacy checkpoint controls. This does not change runtime support for existing durable legacy chains. Set this to `true` before directly managing a legacy chain with `append-step`, `approve-checkpoint`, or `reject-checkpoint`.

## `inlineToolDisplay`

```json
{ "inlineToolDisplay": "summary" }
```

Controls the `subagent` tool result shown inline in chat. The default, `"rich"`, shows live child activity and expands to detailed output. `"summary"` keeps the inline result at one stable row for running, completed, failed, stopped, and paused runs; it does not animate, show elapsed time, preview child output, or change when Pi's expand key is pressed. FleetView remains available for live progress and detailed inspection.

## `mainWindowRenderer`

```json
{
  "mainWindowRenderer": {
    "horizontalSpacing": 0,
    "compactResultMaxLines": 4
  }
}
```

Controls only the main chat `subagent` call/result renderer. It does not change child execution, orchestration, FleetView, artifacts, transcripts, or model-facing content.

`horizontalSpacing` is an integer from `0` to `4`. The default preserves current spacing. Set it to `0` to remove the extra spaces before compact result details and between parts of the call row.

`compactResultMaxLines` is a positive integer. It caps only collapsed rich-result rows and adds an expand hint when rows are hidden. Expanded output remains uncapped.

With `"summary"`, a tool result looks like this:

```text
✓ reviewer · completed
```

## `foregroundDetachShortcut`

```json
{ "foregroundDetachShortcut": "ctrl+b" }
```

Optionally binds a shortcut that detaches the active foreground single-subagent run without terminating it. The running foreground card shows the configured shortcut beside its live-detail hint. The default is unset, so pi-subagents does not reserve a global key.

Pi binds `Ctrl+B` to editor cursor-left by default. The extension shortcut takes precedence, but Pi reports the conflict at startup. To reserve the key without that warning, override the editor action in `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "tui.editor.cursorLeft": "left"
}
```

## `orcaProgressTabs` (experimental)

```json
{
  "orcaProgressTabs": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Opt in to a best-effort Orca observer that creates one Orca terminal tab for each subagent child and mirrors its live tool, assistant, stdout, and stderr progress. Tab titles use a persistent worktree-local sequence (`subagent · <agent> · 1`, `... · 2`, and so on), so separate workflows and concurrent children do not reuse the same number. This does **not** replace Pi as the child runner: native Pi children keep the same process, lifecycle, status, control, artifact, and result paths. External CLI profiles also keep their existing runner and can mirror their stdout/stderr.

The integration is off by default and supports macOS and Linux. It is disabled on Windows. When enabled, `pi-subagents` looks for executable `orca` on `PATH`, or uses the executable path in `PI_SUBAGENT_ORCA_BINARY`. If no executable is available, Orca is not running, the cwd is not an Orca-managed worktree, or `terminal create` fails, the authoritative subagent still runs normally. Tab creation is deliberately best-effort and never changes the child result.

Set `enabled` to `false` (or remove the block) as a kill switch. In that state, `pi-subagents` does not invoke `orca` and creates no Orca tabs. The temporary mirror files contain child output, use private file modes where supported, and are removed shortly after the child finishes. Each mirror is capped at 1 MiB. The observer stops accepting progress when the cap or stream backpressure is reached and appends a truncation notice. The viewer removes terminal control sequences with parser state that persists across file reads. On completion, the viewer exits back to the Orca terminal's shell prompt; the tab and its terminal scrollback remain open until the user closes the tab. A successfully completed native Pi child with a recorded session ends with a safely quoted `rm -- <exact-session-path>` command; failed, stopped, timed-out, and sessionless children do not show the removal command.

## `asyncByDefault`

```json
{ "asyncByDefault": false }
```

WorkflowScript calls use background execution when the request omits `async`. Set `asyncByDefault` to `false` to restore foreground-by-default behavior for tool launches that still use the internal single-run primitive. Callers can still force foreground with `async: false` unless `forceTopLevelAsync` is enabled.

## `fleetView`

```json
{ "fleetView": false }
```

Controls the persistent, navigable FleetView. The default is `true`. Set it to `false` to hide FleetView without disabling status tracking, completion notifications, `/subagents-fleet`, or lifecycle events.

## `fleetViewPlacement`

```json
{ "fleetViewPlacement": "aboveEditor" }
```

Places the persistent FleetView either `"belowEditor"` or `"aboveEditor"`. The default is `"belowEditor"`; invalid values fall back to `"belowEditor"`.

## `fleetKeybindings`

```json
{
  "fleetKeybindings": {
    "pageUp": ["u"],
    "pageDown": ["d"],
    "selectFirst": ["g"],
    "selectLast": ["G"]
  }
}
```

Customizes only the full Fleet inspector opened by `/subagents-fleet` or FleetView inspection. It does not change Pi's global keybindings or the compact persistent FleetView.

Each action accepts a non-empty array of key strings. Configured actions replace their defaults. Unset actions keep the defaults: `selectUp` is `up`/`k`, `selectDown` is `down`/`j`, `scrollUp` is `K`, `scrollDown` is `J`, `pageUp` is `pageUp`, `pageDown` is `pageDown`, `selectFirst` is `home`, `selectLast` is `end`, `toggleTools` is `x`/`X`/`ctrl+o`, `refresh` is `r`/`R`, `steer` is `s`, `stop` is `D`, `inspect` is `H`, and `close` is `escape`/`ctrl+c`/`q`.

Prompt modes keep their fixed keys. For example, `Esc` still cancels steer text or stop confirmation even when the Fleet-level close binding is changed.

## `asyncWidget`

```json
{ "asyncWidget": true }
```

Controls the under-editor widget for active background runs. It defaults to `true`, including when FleetView is enabled, so active work remains visible after reload. Set it to `false` to hide this widget while keeping FleetView available.

## `waitTool`

```json
{ "waitTool": { "enabled": false } }
```

Keeps the `subagent_wait` tool registered but makes direct calls return immediately instead of blocking on active subagent or provider work. The default is enabled. You can also set `"waitTool": false`; set `PI_SUBAGENT_WAIT_TOOL_ENABLED=false` (or `0`, `off`, `disabled`) to override config for one process. The effective value is passed explicitly to child runtimes. Headless `agent_end` auto-drain remains a lifecycle safeguard even when direct wait calls are disabled. Invalid config or environment values fail instead of being coerced.

Blocking `subagent_wait({ id: "..." })` keeps the current tool call open until that run changes. In a long-lived interactive parent session, `subagent_wait({ id: "...", nonBlocking: true })` instead resolves the prefix once, persists the exact run identity, returns a subscription token immediately, and wakes that session on completion, failure, attention, reconciliation failure, or timeout. Armed subscriptions appear in ordinary `subagent({ action: "status" })` output and are not counted as active child work.

This is different from `waitTool.enabled=false`, which returns immediately without registering any future wake. Provider items remain available only to blocking fleet-wide waits; non-blocking subscriptions require one async or remembered detached foreground run id.

## `forceTopLevelAsync`

```json
{ "forceTopLevelAsync": true }
```

Forces depth-0 internal single, parallel, and chain runs into background mode and bypasses launch UI by forcing `clarify: false`. Nested calls keep their own inherited settings.

## `timeoutMs`

```json
{ "timeoutMs": 3600000 }
```

Global default runtime deadline, in milliseconds, for subagent runs. It replaces the built-in 30-minute backstop for foreground launches (single, parallel, chain, and workflowScript) and plain single-agent async runs whenever no call-level `timeoutMs`/`maxRuntimeMs` applies. For single-agent launches, selected agent frontmatter `timeoutMs` still wins. This only moves the *default*.

Use it when foreground orchestration or plain async single-agent runs need a longer default than 30 minutes. It does not set async composite top-level deadlines, and it does not replace async fan-out child deadlines.

Composite async runs (async chains, parallel tasks, and scripted workflows) stay unbounded at the top level by design. Their runner children are bounded individually by their own agent or runner defaults, so this value does not cap them. Must be a positive integer no greater than `2147483647` (the largest delay a Node.js timer can honor, roughly 24.8 days); invalid or out-of-range values are ignored and the built-in defaults apply.

## `toolTimeoutMs`

```json
{ "toolTimeoutMs": 600000 }
```

Optional hard per-tool-call deadline in milliseconds. When configured, a child that emits `tool_execution_start` but not `tool_execution_end` is terminated with `timedOut: true` and a tool-specific error. The effective value is resolved per child: explicit `subagent` call value, then agent frontmatter, then this config value, then `PI_SUBAGENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`.

Without a configured value, Pi still applies a five-minute hard timeout to known-fast built-in tools: `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `edit`, `write`, and `structured_output`. Long-running tools such as `bash`, custom tools, and MCP tools do not get a hard default. They get the normal open-tool attention notice after `activeNoticeAfterMs` and remain bounded by the run-level deadline.

The tool timer tracks each active `toolCallId` separately and never extends the run-level deadline: when the remaining run budget is shorter, the ordinary run-level timeout wins. `contact_supervisor`, `intercom`, and `subagent_wait` are exempt because their legitimate purpose can be to wait for a human, supervisor, or child run. Use hard tool timeouts only for wedge protection; an elapsed timeout is not a mutation-safe boundary. Configured values must be positive integers no greater than `2147483647`; invalid or out-of-range values are rejected with a visible error rather than silently ignored.

## `globalConcurrencyLimit`

```json
{ "globalConcurrencyLimit": 20 }
```

Caps simultaneously running children inside existing durable legacy multi-child runs. New orchestration uses `workflowScript` and `runs.all`.

## `maxSubagentSpawnsPerSession`

```json
{ "maxSubagentSpawnsPerSession": 100 }
```

Optionally caps the total number of child subagent launches during one parent session, including completed and failed children, parallel task counts, static chain steps, and bounded dynamic fanout children. Sessions are unlimited by default. Set this value to `0` to disable a configured cap. `PI_SUBAGENT_MAX_SPAWNS_PER_SESSION` overrides the config for a process and follows the same positive-cap/zero-unlimited semantics.

`subagent({ action: "status" })`, fleet status, and `subagent({ action: "doctor" })` expose used, effective limit, remaining capacity, grants, and the remaining grant allowance for this budget. A user may explicitly call `subagent({ action: "grant-spawn-budget", additional: 10 })` from the root interactive parent after all children settle and confirm the native prompt. Grants are additive: they never erase cumulative usage, are rejected for unlimited sessions and child/headless callers, and total granted capacity cannot exceed the original configured cap. Compaction remains part of the same logical parent session and does not reset usage or grants; starting a new parent session does.

## `maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun`

```json
{ "maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun": 64 }
```

Caps cumulative logical child admissions in one top-level run tree. The default is `64`. `PI_SUBAGENT_MAX_SPAWNS_PER_RUN` overrides the config when it is a positive integer. Invalid, zero, or missing values fall back to the configured positive value or `64`.

The budget counts single launches, expanded `tasks`/`count`, static chain steps and parallel groups, actual dynamic `expand` items, appended chain steps, workflow children, and nested child calls. Static and materialized dynamic groups are admitted atomically. Startup retries, model fallback, and retained-child resume reuse the original logical child claim. Claims are never released or refunded. This cap is independent from the session-wide cumulative spawn budget and `globalConcurrencyLimit`.

## `maxActiveAsyncRunsPerSession`

```json
{ "maxActiveAsyncRunsPerSession": 4 }
```

Optionally caps concurrently active top-level async runs owned by one parent session. Unset or `0` keeps the existing unlimited behavior. A positive integer reserves one slot before an async single, parallel, chain, or workflow creates run artifacts or starts children. Foreground runs and nested/workflow children do not reserve another slot.

Queued, running, paused, and needs-attention runs retain capacity. Runner-backed slots release only after terminal logical state and matching observed process-terminal proof from #1030. Missing, malformed, or unknown cleanup proof retains the slot. A terminal async workflow releases after its controller is gone and every launched child is accounted for: awaited foreground children are covered by workflow settlement, while actual background children still require observed process-terminal proof. Resume transfers the source slot without a second charge. Dismissal and history cleanup do not release capacity.

This limit bounds current top-level async load. It is separate from cumulative `maxSubagentSpawnsPerSession`, `maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun`, and `globalConcurrencyLimit`.

`subagent({ action: "status" })`, fleet status, and `subagent({ action: "doctor" })` expose used, effective limit, and remaining active capacity. Static chains and parallel calls fail before creating run artifacts or starting partial work when their declared capacity cannot fit. Later retries or unbounded dynamic work are not guaranteed by that preflight.

## `scheduledRuns`

```json
{ "scheduledRuns": { "enabled": false, "maxPending": 20 } }
```

Durable schedules are enabled by default and stored per project under `.pi/subagents/schedules/<id>/`. See [missions.md](missions.md#schedules) for usage.

Set `storeRoot` to keep durable schedules outside project repositories. It must be an absolute path or a `~/` path, which expands from the user home directory. Each project is stored under a hash of its resolved working directory, so projects do not share schedules.

```json
{ "scheduledRuns": { "storeRoot": "~/.local/share/pi-subagents/schedules" } }
```

When `storeRoot` is omitted, schedules remain at `<cwd>/.pi/subagents/schedules`.

## `parallel`

```json
{
  "parallel": {
    "maxTasks": 12,
    "concurrency": 6
  }
}
```

`maxTasks` defaults to `8`; `concurrency` defaults to `4`. Per-call `concurrency` takes precedence.

## `defaultSessionDir`

```json
{ "defaultSessionDir": "~/.pi/agent/sessions/subagent/" }
```

Session directory precedence is: `params.sessionDir`, then `config.defaultSessionDir`, then a directory derived from the parent session. Sessions are always enabled.

## `singleRunOutputBaseDir`

```json
{ "singleRunOutputBaseDir": "~/.pi/subagent-outputs" }
```

Routes relative `output` paths for single-agent `/run` calls under this directory. Absolute per-call or agent output paths are still used as-is. When unset, relative single-run outputs go under the run's output artifact directory instead of the project root.

## `maxSubagentDepth`

```json
{ "maxSubagentDepth": 1 }
```

Controls nested delegation when no inherited `PI_SUBAGENT_MAX_DEPTH` is already in effect. Per-agent `maxSubagentDepth` can tighten the limit for that agent's child runs, but cannot relax an inherited stricter limit. This applies even to children that explicitly declare `tools: subagent`; at the cap, execution fanout is blocked instead of silently hiding nested work.

## `PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY`

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY=/path/to/pi-or-wrapper
```

Overrides the command used to launch child Pi processes. Package wrappers can set this to their own `pi`/agent binary so subagents inherit wrapper flags, environment setup, and bundled resources without relying on `PATH` ordering. Empty or whitespace-only values are ignored.

## `PI_SUBAGENT_TASK_DELIVERY`

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_TASK_DELIVERY=file   # auto | file (default: auto)
```

Controls how the task text reaches the child Pi process. `auto` (default) passes short tasks as an inline argv token and writes tasks longer than 8000 characters to a temp `task.md` referenced as `@<path>`. `file` always uses a temp file, keeping the task out of argv entirely.

Use `file` on hosts where endpoint protection (EDR) pre-execution scanning denies child processes whose command line embeds a long natural-language task — that denial surfaces as an immediate zero-activity `SIGKILL`. Independently of this setting, startup retries automatically escalate to file delivery after an unexplained zero-activity `SIGKILL`. Empty, whitespace-only, or unrecognized values fall back to `auto`.

## `intercomBridge`

```json
{
  "intercomBridge": {
    "mode": "always",
    "instructionFile": "./intercom-bridge.md",
    "resultDelivery": true
  }
}
```

Controls whether subagents receive runtime coordination instructions and whether `contact_supervisor` is auto-added to their tool allowlist when needed.

Fields:

- `mode`: default `always`; use `fork-only` to inject only for forked runs, or `off` to disable the bridge.
- `instructionFile`: optional Markdown template replacing the default bridge instructions. `{orchestratorTarget}` is interpolated. Relative paths resolve from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/`.
- `resultDelivery`: default `false`; set `true` only when an external listener consumes `subagent:result-intercom` and acknowledges the grouped completion payload. This is optional external result delivery, not native supervisor messaging. Enabled delivery waits for acknowledgement and reports acknowledgement failures. It does not change supervisor asks or progress updates.

Bridge activation requires a targetable current parent session id, which `pi-subagents` passes to children automatically. Native supervisor messaging does not require an external `pi-intercom` installation or per-agent extension allowlists: children use `contact_supervisor`, and parents use `subagent_supervisor` to inspect or reply. Agents can still use an external `intercom` tool when they explicitly request a provider that supplies it.

The default injected guidance tells children to use `contact_supervisor` with `reason: "need_decision"` when blocked or needing a decision, `reason: "progress_update"` only for meaningful blocked/progress updates, and avoid routine completion handoffs.

## `worktreeBaseDir`

```json
{ "worktreeBaseDir": "/Users/matt/code/.worktrees/pi-subagents" }
```

Sets the base directory for `worktree: true` runs. Relative paths resolve from the repository root, `~/...` expands to your home directory, and `PI_SUBAGENTS_WORKTREE_DIR` is used when config is unset. The default remains the system temp directory.

## `worktreeSetupHook`

```json
{
  "worktreeSetupHook": "./scripts/setup-worktree.mjs",
  "worktreeSetupHookTimeoutMs": 45000
}
```

The hook runs once per created worktree. Paths must be absolute, `~/...`, or repo-relative; bare command names are rejected.

stdin is a JSON object with `repoRoot`, `worktreePath`, `agentCwd`, `branch`, `index`, `runId`, and `baseCommit`. stdout must be one JSON object, for example:

```json
{ "syntheticPaths": [".venv", ".env.local"] }
```

`syntheticPaths` must be relative to the worktree root. They are removed before diff capture so helper files do not pollute patches. Tracked files are never excluded; marking a tracked path as synthetic fails setup. Default timeout is `30000` ms.

## `missions`

```json
{
  "missions": {
    "enabled": true,
    "globalIndex": true,
    "retainTerminal": 200
  }
}
```

Automatic missions are enabled by default for ordinary launches with a task. Use per-launch `mission: false` for intentionally ephemeral work, or set `enabled: false` to disable automatic creation globally; explicit mission actions and `missionId`/`mission` launch fields still work.

- Mission records default to a project-keyed directory under pi's agent directory (`~/.pi/agent/missions/projects/<project-hash>/`). This keeps the project worktree clean.
- `directory` may be absolute, `~/...`, or project-relative. Set it to `.pi/subagents/missions` to opt in to project-scoped records.
- `retainTerminal` is a positive count (default `200`); pruning removes only the oldest completed, failed, or cancelled records and their pointers, never planned, active, waiting, needs-decision, or corrupt records.
- The user-global index contains pointers only; missing-record pointers self-heal when globally listed. Set `globalIndex: false` to disable writes or `globalIndexDir` to redirect it.

## `authorityPolicy`

```json
{
  "authorityPolicy": {
    "discardWorktree": "confirm",
    "destructiveCleanup": "confirm",
    "spawnBudgetGrant": "confirm",
    "scheduleCreate": "auto",
    "stopRun": "auto",
    "steerRun": "auto"
  }
}
```

Each fixed action resolves to `"auto"`, `"confirm"`, or `"forbid"`. This is intentionally a small action map, not a generic policy language. Confirm-required control actions fail closed without an interactive UI.

## `artifactDir`

```json
{ "artifactDir": "session" }
```

Controls where subagent artifact files (inputs, outputs, transcripts, metadata) are stored:

- `"project"`: writes to `<cwd>/.pi/subagents/artifacts/`.
- `"session"` (default): stores artifacts under pi's session directory (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/<session>/subagent-artifacts/`), keeping the working directory clean. It falls back to the OS temp directory when no session file exists.
- `"temp"`: uses the OS temp directory.

This preference also controls the default chain scratch directory. `"project"` uses `<cwd>/.pi/subagents/chain-runs/`, while the default `"session"` and `"temp"` use the user-scoped temp chain directory.

The `"session"` option uses the same directory that `cleanupAllArtifactDirs` already scans for age-based cleanup, so artifacts are still cleaned up automatically. Temporary chain directories are cleaned up separately after 24 hours.

When a project-scoped launch runs from an npm package directory, pi-subagents warns if package settings can include `.pi/subagents/` in the published package. Add `.pi/subagents/` to `.npmignore` (or `.gitignore` when no `.npmignore` exists), use a `files` allowlist that does not include `.pi/subagents/`, or select `"session"` or `"temp"`.

## `completionBatch`

```json
{
  "completionBatch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "debounceMs": 150,
    "maxWaitMs": 1000,
    "stragglerDebounceMs": 75,
    "stragglerMaxWaitMs": 400,
    "stragglerWindowMs": 2000
  }
}
```

Controls smart batching of async-completion notifications. When several background subagents finish within a short window, their successful completions are held briefly and delivered as a single quiet grouped completion instead of separate completions.

- A hard `maxWaitMs` cap (measured from the first completion in a group) guarantees nothing is held indefinitely.
- Late-finishing siblings that arrive within `stragglerWindowMs` of a group emit join a shorter straggler group governed by `stragglerDebounceMs` and `stragglerMaxWaitMs`.
- Failed and paused completions bypass batching and fire immediately, flushing any held successes first, so failure and needs-attention signals are never delayed.
- Set `enabled` to `false` to restore the original one-notification-per-completion behavior. Changes apply on the next session start.

## `permissions`

Native child tool permission rules. See [watchdog.md](watchdog.md#native-child-tool-permissions).
